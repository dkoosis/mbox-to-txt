We’re now getting decent WiFi speed at the office after the changes we made

Xaiver mac book is uploading a large amount of data into box today, this should be avoided once we set up the NAS so locally Xaiver should put his data in the nas and then the nas uploads it into box using a wired GB ethernet connection (much faster). Now I
already reached out to box to see if there is anything going on with our web instance, they confirmed all is well. I asked them to run a report of the traffic and then send it over to me, I will let you know what I find when I looked through it.

Subject: Re: BOX

Hello Sam
It looks like
Xaiver mac book is uploading a large amount of data into box today, this should be avoided once we set up the NAS so locally Xaiver should put his data in the nas and then the nas uploads it into box using a wired GB ethernet connection (much faster). Now I already reached out to box to see if there is anything going on with our web instance, they confirmed all is well. I asked them to run a report of the traffic and then send it over to me, I will let you know what I find when I looked through it.

I use the browser interface with Box. Also I'm done uploading. I just feel like it shouldn't take 10 min to upload a 2 GB file (unless it should)....
I see, I just check box status page all looked good.
Do me a favor and see if you could end box drive through the activity monitor?
Go to spotlight search acitivty monitor then sort by program box.
Click on it and then end task and relaunch it through applications

David,
I looked into this and have a plan for tomorrow. They have two computers that currently have Sophos installed and are in isolation mode as the company that managed it is no longer around, making it unusable. There are ways to bypass tamper protection by changing registry keys and deleting certain files, but this process is time-consuming. Since Ed is okay with wiping the computer and starting fresh, it might be a good idea to reinstall Windows and then have Ed install his Office, Adobe suite, printers and so on.
I can make this happen tomorrow if that works for you!
Please let me know your thoughts.

Hi David,
We still had an issue on our ethernet connected pc's and I wonder if you could stop in to see us at PHA room 514, if you are in the building, when the other users (Erik and Charles) would be here?
I had a similar issue on my pc but was able to uninstall a Sophos program that was causing this, a legacy installation of a prior administration at Alpha.

Hey Ed
If it was working before it should be working now. For the moment the
Best thing to do would be to try a different Port or switch to Wi-Fi. I can take a closer look on Monday.. I'm about to be off the grid for 3 hours, so forgive me if these don't solve your problem right away.

It's still an issue somewhere in my environment - is it cached in the

Hello Steven,
I have checked Lisa Archigian's mailbox and confirmed her mailbox is fine. In addition, Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa in GSuite tenant. I need more detail of the issue. Are you seeing this from your Gmail contact list or elsewhere?

Hello Leon,
We reviewed this with our Service Desk Manager.
The request for Phoenix’s offboarding was sent in on 6/4/2024. This was completed the same day by Dan.
Our process for offboarding is to have a ticket submitted via an offboarding template.
Part of that offboarding is to remove licenses from the offboarded user however we do not delete accounts unless specifically noted.
In the case of Phoenix, this was completed.
Within Adobe there is no license assigned. Same for slack. ( See screenshots below)
The tickets you are reviewing have been automatically closed because they are being submitted from an automated system on your side.
I am not sure what triggers your system to determine if users have a license or not. Doing a physical check shows no license is assigned.
In regards to Ben, We do not manage the Momentus application. That was never in our application list.
As noted in past conversations, there have been some changes on what applications are supported internally vs what we have historically supported. We can revisit the application list again on our next call if you like.

The thought is that chromebooks are sufficient for most intern roles, they are less expensive, and they are easier to manage (via Google Admin console)

Hi Clinton,
It's still an issue somewhere in my environment - is it cached in the Shared Contacts for Google app? See screenshot below from a test meeting I just attempted to schedule.

Good morning, Steven,
Thank you for the picture. You're right that is strange. I have checked Zoom just now - only Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa. Was Lisa Dent added to PHA x MGC meeting back in the day? This can be cached previously. But so far Lisa Archigian, email and Zoom profile is fine. Let me know what you would like me to do next.

Hello Steven,
I have checked Lisa Archigian's mailbox and confirmed her mailbox is fine. In addition, Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa in GSuite tenant. I need more detail of the issue. Are you seeing this from your Gmail contact list or elsewhere?

Hi Clinton,
It's still an issue somewhere in my environment - is it cached in the Shared Contacts for Google app? See screenshot below from a test meeting I just attempted to schedule.

Hello Steven,
I have tested calendar meetings - Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa I see.
I suspected Lisa Dent was added to your contact.
Please go to Contact > Contact / Directory / Frequent / Other contacts > 3 Dots Delete Lisa Dent contact. Let me know if it works for you.

Hi Leon,
Just a quick follow-up. We will need the approval by November 20th. If we do not get signature by that date, your licensing will go month-to-month with a 20% increase on each license. You can always go from month-to-month to annual. This is all mandated by Microsoft, not Omega.
Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you, Erika

Erika,
I discussed with David, and we want to maintain our monthly commitments. We’re also looking to clean up our current list of users to ensure we’re licensing only those actively using the MS Office suite. I hope Daniel can provide us with a list of user’s activity, who have been using the suite actively and those who have not.

Hi Leon,
Thank you for your email. I had sent over the list of licensing with the users attached. If you want to do any clean up with those licenses, now is the time to do so. I am glad you are doing your due diligence. You can send any changes directly to support.
For additional information, such as activity, you can send that to support as well support@thetnsgroup.com and you can copy me, so we have a ticket for Dan/our team to work from.

Hello Steven,
Thank you for getting back to me and you're welcome. Here is a quick recap - you've reported seeing ex-employee in your Gmail contact list. First, we have confirmed Lisa Archigian was the only Lisa in the company. Then advised you to check your contacts. You've deleted Lisa Dent contact and confirmed she no longer appears.
If there is anything else you need assistance with, please feel free to respond to this email or give us a call.
I will mark this ticket as resolve for now. Thank you and have a great week!

I have tested calendar meetings - Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa I see.
I suspected Lisa Dent was added to your contact.

Hi Clinton,
It's still an issue somewhere in my environment - is it cached in the Shared Contacts for Google app? See screenshot below from a test meeting I just attempted to schedule.

Good morning, Steven,
Thank you for the picture. You're right that is strange. I have checked Zoom just now - only Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa. Was Lisa Dent added to PHA x MGC meeting back in the day? This can be cached previously. But so far Lisa Archigian, email and Zoom profile is fine. Let me know what you would like me to do next.

Hello Steven,
Thank you for getting back to me and you're welcome. Here is a quick recap - you've reported seeing ex-employee in your Gmail contact list. First, we have confirmed Lisa Archigian was the only Lisa in the company. Then advised you to check your contacts. You've
deleted Lisa Dent contact and confirmed she no longer appears.
If there is anything else you need assistance with, please feel free to respond to this email or give us a call.
I will mark this ticket as resolve for now. Thank you and have a great week!

Hello Steven,
I have tested calendar meetings - Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa I see.
I suspected Lisa Dent was added to your contact.
Please go to Contact > Contact / Directory / Frequent / Other contacts > 3 Dots Delete Lisa Dent contact. Let me know if it works for you.

Hi Clinton,
It's still an issue somewhere in my environment - is it cached in the Shared Contacts for Google app? See screenshot below from a test meeting I just attempted to schedule.

Good morning, Steven,
Thank you for the picture. You're right that is strange. I have checked Zoom just now - only Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa. Was Lisa Dent added to PHA x MGC meeting back in the day? This can be cached previously. But so far Lisa Archigian, email and Zoom
profile is fine. Let me know what you would like me to do next.

Please go to Contact > Contact / Directory / Frequent / Other contacts > 3 Dots Delete Lisa Dent contact. Let me know if it works for you.

Hi Clinton,
It's still an issue somewhere in my environment - is it cached in the Shared Contacts for Google app? See screenshot below from a test meeting I just attempted to schedule.

Good morning, Steven,
Thank you for the picture. You're right that is strange. I have checked Zoom just now - only Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa. Was Lisa Dent added to PHA x MGC meeting back in the day? This can be cached previously. But so far Lisa Archigian, email and Zoom
profile is fine. Let me know what you would like me to do next.

Hello Steven,
I have checked Lisa Archigian's mailbox and confirmed her mailbox is fine. In addition, Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa in GSuite tenant. I need more detail of the issue. Are you seeing this from your Gmail contact list or elsewhere?
Hear from you soon.

Hello,
As part of the Cloudflare SSL certificate renewal process, we need you to re-approve the domain broolynprintfair.com<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=http%3a%2f%2fbroolynprintfair.com&c=E,1,ojnzhzORE0_6fdin7k5wO9rHiT1Kb5HzE0ee1CyCgYImKQ1mns1RFBIlTk5yZFCqyxs9mplPom8IPI-7tSfhGtC-F8elxcGDQjA8F-jIOeUY_wtPsn_-eg,,&typo=1> so that we can re-issue SSL certificates for use on our network.
If you previously validated this domain using the HTTP DCV method, :

Hey:
Notice, note below is for the first domain which I accidentally registered.
This is broolynprintfair (TYPO) we also have brooklynprintfair (CORRECT).
We can let this one die. Please do whatever you think makes sense, and let me know what you decide.
Thanks,
