To:
Dear Valued Customer,
As an admin or owner of an account utilizing Zoom Phone, we are reaching
out to notify you that we have acknowledged the changes you have made to
the Phone licenses on your subscription. Our engineering team has
identified that some of your users may still be on your old calling plan.
In an effort to ensure you do not lose important user profile information,
we are allowing you 6 calendar days from the date of change, to make any
updates and ensure all your users are on an active plan. If you do not make
the changes within this period, the user profiles associated with your
originally assigned licenses will be lost. Please take advantage of this 6
days grace period. *At the end of the 6 days, the user profiles for the new
licenses on your account in your Admin portal will have to be reconfigured
in your Admin portal.*
If you do not make these updates, 6 calendar days from the date of change,
your users may lose some of their Zoom Phone privileges and key
functionalities.
If you need additional information, please reference our Support
page.

Subject: Box folder access question
To: David Koosis , Daniel Lucas
Hi David and Daniel,
would it be possible to give all PH Admin staff and all fabrication shop staff access to the 00_Events by Year folder in box which is in Operations > Events & Rentals. But to only give them access to that folder so they can store and look up Powerhouse Public
Events information, but not give them access to other folders within Ops > Events and Rentals.
Is that possible?
Thank you.

Please set up an email:

This needs to be done at the routing level to retain the original sender's

Daniel,
We’re now getting decent WiFi speed at the office after the changes we made
yesterday, so I’m not sure if we still need the NAS for that purpose. Let’s
discuss.

Xaiver mac book is uploading a large amount of data into box today, this should be avoided once we set up the NAS so locally Xaiver should put his data in the nas and then the nas uploads it into box using a wired GB ethernet connection (much faster). Now I
already reached out to box to see if there is anything going on with our web instance, they confirmed all is well. I asked them to run a report of the traffic and then send it over to me, I will let you know what I find when I looked through it.

Hi Mitch,
I understand that you submitted a ticket to support regarding Kode Labs - Service Ticket #5226123 - Re: Kode Labs / TNS - Contact Info. Was your outreach in the ticket to me, Erika or to another Erica within Kode Labs.
If it was for me, I have not received any of these tickets until Rob brought it to my attention, today. As discussed with the past correspondence regarding the generator, I do not receive copies of all tickets submitted unless I am copied. Should you need me to have visibility into a support request, please copy me via email or reach out directly to eellis@thetnsgroup.com.
I want to make sure our communication is correct and clear. I believe I have given you my cell phone and the process to contact me via email. I am more than happy to jump in and help in any way.
Please let me know if there were anything you would like to discuss, at this time.
Again, I just want to make sure I don't miss anything, and we are on the same page. I look forward to hearing back.
Warm regards, Erika

Mitch,
It appears as though you have Erika’s contact associated with support on your side.
You will need to edit your contacts for both Erika and Support. This would explain the confusion

Hi David,
Thanks for your response. I can confirm that your current connection is the
Google one. Unfortunately, after an IdP change, it's a known issue that the
data in the Admin Console occasionally will not reflect the change.
Fortunately, this is only a cosmetic issue, and can be safely ignored.

Hi Jennifer,
Thank you for the outreach. First, I wanted to clarify the email address you sent your email to - tns@powerhousearts.org. See below – were you trying to send this request to support? If so, it needs to go to support@thetnsgroup.com. If you send to the tns@ email address, our team will not get it.
In terms of backups – Powerhouse does not have onsite servers to hold data. The policy is for users to store files in Box. Powerhouse has a Business Plus plan and any backups/replications are through Box.
Please let me know if you need anything further. Thank you, Erika

Hey David
This is approved!
Brittni do you think anyone joining the crew moving forward should have
similar tech set up? If so then it will all be taken care of when you make
the request.

Subject: New PA staffer account set-up

Hi there,
We have a new part-time hire that PA needs to be able to communicate with
via Slack and Asana. What's the process to get him set-up on those
platforms? I imagine he might also need a PHA email address to facilitate
this?
Kindly let me know what info you might need from me to support further!
Rich Watts is the individual. He started on our team last week. Currently
reachable at rich@superaok.com.
Many thanks,
BC

Jennifer Choi (copied) has downloaded a software package from Bank of America, which she requires for her work.
The installation may require privileges and tinkering.
There's a check scanner connected to her computer, which the software uses.
I'm available to put hands on if needed, at 646-481-4141.

Agreed re: shared resources and IT maintaining a library of X amount of
ipads that can be checked out as needed - that would be great.
Event Sales would like one for site visits to show photos, floorplans, take
notes, etc. That one may have to be its own standalone.

Subject: Re: 3 iPad Airs for Community Engagement and Partnerships

TBH these slipped past me.
See TNS ticket. below.
I discussed 3 iPads with TNS for Dev and Programs. But these are a
different 3 iPads.
If you agree that it makes sense for the teams to treat these as shared
resources, really needed for events and not everyday use, then I'd look
into IT maintaining a library of 5 (?) iPads that could be checked out as
needed. Do you want me to do that?
If they are going to use them frequently, I'd assign them to individuals,
just like a laptop.

Hi TNS and friends,
Hope you all are safe and well.
I'm reaching out because I have a few tech needs for my upcoming
Conversation Series program in April and I want to know what's the best way
to proceed with purchasing.
Initially, I was thinking that my dept. (Community Engagement and
Partnerships) could purchase the items and be responsible for safekeeping
and maintenance, but since it's looking like these items could be shared by
other depts. I'm wondering if it would be best to purchase through TNS.
This way our items would be insured and not our dept.'s individual
responsibility. What are your thoughts?
The items we are needing are listed below:
- 3 iPads
- Roland Aerocaster: https://proav.roland.com/global/products/aerocaster/
https://www.amazon.com/Roland-AeroCaster-Live-Streaming-System/dp/B09NXQ64M8
Thank you,
Jackie Veliz

Hi Erika:
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving!
For our meeting, besides your standard agenda, please:
- take a scan through any emails for any questions or requests I've sent to support@tns or to your team; I will too.
- let me know any ideas you have about how we can do a better job of getting service requests resolved with fewer interactions and better closure?
Some service requests take several rounds of back-and-forth and then sort of peter out without the customer acknowledging that their problem was solved.
I'm thinking of Megan, with her Aternal request, and the current salesforce login issue; and the business with "wifi at the gatehouse." I'm not saying TNS is doing anything wrong. In fact, I may have muddied the waters by getting involved. I'm saying I want consider what it takes to raise the bar.

We are all set for Wednesday, I should have the agenda sent to you by tomorrow. If you have anything specific that you want to discuss, please let me know once I send it.

Subject: clarification regarding "wifi project"
EXTERNAL EMAIL!!!
Hello Erika & Team:
I'm plowing through emails and notes, and noticed this, from last month's TNS/Powerhouse status call:
Wi-Fi Project
Quote was sent for visibility purposes; TNS wanted to clarify the request and to ensure the cabling is in place should we move forward, prior to approval
It was agreed to delete this quote – we are not going forward at this time
When walking around, physical access points that unlock the doors are on Wi-Fi and some are responding slowly
there may be a desire to add access points
TNS was asked for additional coverage – 2 access points in the parking lot – they are not directly attached to the access system
Concern that Dan is getting pulled in different directions and we need to do some realignment
Any quote requests, TNS to walk away and alert to Steven or David so they can investigate further
Action:
David to speak to Mitch to clarify his askes for the 2 Access Points in the parking lot
I want to clarify and close the loop on this.
1. I have not yet met with Mitch, but I plan to this week.
2. Above, does the "Wi-Fi" project refer to the two AP's Mitch requested for the parking lot? Anything additional?
3. Did Mitch request the two APs in the parking lot because he expected that would fix the slow-responding doors, or is that separate?
Thanks

I'll check on it.
I think your hunch is correct that it's POM, not Omega, in which case I'll
follow up with Mitch.
I also will follow up on a backlog task with Omega: confirm we're getting
alerts on all the tech-related UPS's.

can you add additional columns including:

Can you propose a few times Thu/Fri?
Hi David,
I wanted to follow-up on the thread below. Did you still want to schedule a time to meet with myself and Rob to discuss the partnership and Brightgauge reporting.
I am sure things are busy on your side, we will do our best to be available when time permits.
Thank you, Erika

Hi David,
It was great to meet you as well! Thank you for your kind words and the healthy conversation, but it was my fault. I was so focused on our discussion and making sure I captured everything in my notes. I apologize to you all for the inconvenience/oversight.
Rob and I welcome the chance to meet in person at Powerhouse, as things progress. From there, we can create a cadence for visits as needed.
In the meantime, I am available on Monday from 11 am – 3 pm. I am more than happy to spend as much time as needed.
In terms of reporting, Rob shared the Brightgauge dashboard on our call yesterday. I would like to schedule some time with Rob, myself, and you on Monday to review the Brightgauge reporting - Rob is available on Monday between 12 pm – 2 pm. From there, we can determine if there are any additional reports that you would like to receive.
Just let me know what times are best for you to schedule the two meetings on Monday, if you are open to it, and I can send out invites via Zoom.

It was good meeting you yesterday! I can't tell you how many times that I've been intently focused on a conversation -- as we were yesterday -- and missed it when a new zoom participant showed up. Sorry that happened!
What's a good way to schedule time with you, generally?
If you have availability to speak Fri or Mon, name some times and I'll make that work. My general schedule is to be onsite at Powerhouse Tue-Thu.
I want to speak to you to understand the current relationship between Powerhouse and TNS; your observations about what's working and where there are challenges; your thoughts about how Powerhouse's needs are evolving; your input on any support you may desire from your own organization in order to serve Powerhouse in the best way.
If you haven't already, please share to my vcto@powerhousearts.org email address whatever contract or scope documents you think may be helpful. If you have monthly reports or critical incident reports, and it won't take more than an hour to put together, please send that my way too.
Thank you,
/dk

Hi David,
It was great to meet you as well! Thank you for your kind words and the healthy conversation, but it was my fault. I was so focused on our discussion and making sure I captured everything in my notes. I apologize to you all for the inconvenience/oversight.
Rob and I welcome the chance to meet in person at Powerhouse, as things progress. From there, we can create a cadence for visits as needed.
In the meantime, I am available on Monday from 11 am – 3 pm. I am more than happy to spend as much time as needed.
In terms of reporting, Rob shared the Brightgauge dashboard on our call yesterday. I would like to schedule some time with Rob, myself, and you on Monday to review the Brightgauge reporting - Rob is available on Monday between 12 pm – 2 pm. From there, we can determine if there are any additional reports that you would like to receive.
Just let me know what times are best for you to schedule the two meetings on Monday, if you are open to it, and I can send out invites via Zoom.
As noted below, I provided your client login to Powerhouse’s portal below.

It was good meeting you yesterday! I can't tell you how many times that I've been intently focused on a conversation -- as we were yesterday -- and missed it when a new zoom participant showed up. Sorry that happened!
What's a good way to schedule time with you, generally?
If you have availability to speak Fri or Mon, name some times and I'll make that work. My general schedule is to be onsite at Powerhouse Tue-Thu.
I want to speak to you to understand the current relationship between Powerhouse and TNS; your observations about what's working and where there are challenges; your thoughts about how Powerhouse's needs are evolving; your input on any support you may desire from your own organization in order to serve Powerhouse in the best way.
If you haven't already, please share to my vcto@powerhousearts.org email address whatever contract or scope documents you think may be helpful. If you have monthly reports or critical incident reports, and it won't take more than an hour to put together, please send that my way too.
Thank you,

There's a Genetec-dedicated PC and 3 network wall plates.
How many network runs are going to the gatehouse and how many jacks are live?
The idea behind the wireless camera is, I'm told, so that the security company can monitor their employee. It's a WiFi cam not connected to the Genetec surveillance system.

Has Leon created his customer portal account log in?
Attached are instructions for him to do so.
Once he does that we can definitely jump on the line and discuss the portal.

2. Would it be possible for Daniel when he is at Powerhouse this coming

3. We are also hoping to be able to have a TNS technician onsite 8am-11am

EXTERNAL EMAIL!!!
Hi Erika, Rob, Daniel,
I am reaching out because we have another large Fashion show with the same group / client as last September coming up.
The requirements for the internet service provided by the venue are the same and are in detail the following:
The internet connection must be provided through an ethernet cable positioned near the video control room.
The connection must be at least 30 Mbps in upload and download, guaranteed and dedicated to the streaming service.
Wi-Fi connections cannot be used.
To this network will be connected a router from which all the streaming equipment will be connected to.
The IP that will be assigned to the router must be able to make outgoing connections to the following ports / ip:
- TCP ports from 1195 to 1199 to IP 213.137.32.108
- UDP ports from 10001 to 10004 towards IP 213.137.32.108
- UDP ports from 10001 to 10004 towards IP 178.20.73.121
We are again planning on using the ports (marked by blue painters tape) on the recessed east wall of the Grand Hall mezzanine.
TNS, I wanted to check with you the following:
1. Are all these port settings still in place and if not could they please be restored?
2. Would it be possible for Daniel when he is at Powerhouse this coming Wednesday (Feb. 7) to connect with Deesh and go up to the mezzanine and do a streaming test?
3. Erika, I am very sorry this ask comes in again so late, but we are also hoping to be able to have a TNS technician onsite 8am-11am on February 11.
Let us know if this is all doable.
Thank you so much.
Pamela

Thanks, Erika! Yes, Dan helped.
It probably wasn't clear from my email. With Jen, there's been a steady stream of little issues. She's dealing with some more exotic software, because she's the only one in the organization who uses some of the financial software that the bank and the accounting firm require. For instance, she needs a special gadget to scan checks. So when I spoke with Dan I explained this and asked if he would consult with her a little to understand her needs in the bigger picture -- maybe she'd do better with a Windows machine? or one of each? -- so we can consider how to get her set up best, and make sure she knows we're here to help.
Appreciate your help on this, and need to remember you guys can't read my mind. :-)
Yes, as mentioned I talked to Dan this morning and he went to Jennifer immediately when he started the day. He told me he explained the issue to you, and we are waiting to see if Jennifer wants to move to a Windows machine for banking purposes.
Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you, Erika

1. Finally, I restarted my computer to see if that would resolve the issue. When it came back online, I had to re-sign in to everything (which was kinda expected) BUT also, my Zoom was logged out, and the dock was reset. I had to select "Keep in Dock" for all of the apps that had previously already been there. This is less of a problem but mostly just strange.
Anyway, my computer is mostly usable right now, tomorrow is a good day to touchbase and troubleshoot.

Thanks, Erika! Yes, Dan helped.
It probably wasn't clear from my email. With Jen, there's been a steady stream of little issues. She's dealing with some more exotic software, because she's the only one in the organization who uses some of the financial software that the
bank and the accounting firm require. For instance, she needs a special gadget to scan checks. So when I spoke with Dan I explained this and asked if he would consult with her a little to understand her needs in the bigger picture -- maybe she'd do better
with a Windows machine? or one of each? -- so we can consider how to get her set up best, and make sure she knows we're here to help.
Appreciate your help on this, and need to remember you guys can't read my mind. :-)

Hello,
Looping in +David Koosis here as well, since we've already started getting this ball rolling. Since last week my computer has been strange:
1. My Slack isn't very responsive on my computer. Nothing new really comes in or if it comes in, it is severely delayed. The notifications for my new Slack messages don't disappear after reading the message.
* At this point, I am mostly using Slack on my phone
* I am able to send messages, I just can't see any responses on my computer
1. I keep getting the below prompt from Slack to install a new helper tool but it never goes away—even if I type my password in OR if I hit cancel:
*
1. Last week, my Excel basically stopped working. No matter what the spreadsheet is (if I had previously been able to edit that spreadsheet or not). I would get the below message:
*
1. Finally, I restarted my computer to see if that would resolve the issue. When it came back online, I had to re-sign in to everything (which was kinda expected) BUT also, my Zoom was logged out, and the dock was reset. I had to select "Keep in Dock" for all of the apps that had previously already been there. This is less of a problem but mostly just strange.
Anyway, my computer is mostly usable right now, tomorrow is a good day to touchbase and troubleshoot.
Thank you,
Jen

Hello,
Your email inbox megan@powerhousearts.org has been disconnected from your Arternal account.
This connection is important because it allows you to send email from Arternal, automatically track and log emails from your inbox. The most common reason this happens is a password or permissions change.
Reconnecting your inbox will only take a moment. You can do so from the Settings -> Email Settings in the left hand side bar.
See this article for more detailed instructions on how to connect your inbox.

Subject: WiFi requirements for events

Goal: Make WiFi access easy and performant for Powerhouse clients who rent
the space for events, and for event attendees.
These are considerations:
1/ Event techs (Powerhouse clients) need sustained access throughout the
entire event. 30-minute timed connections (which I'm told are current guest
network settings) don't work well.
2/ Event techs may need to stream a movie, Zoom call, or do some other
high bandwidth activity while presenting to event attendees.
3/ The event might include live auction-by-app. These apps are bursty,
with potentially hundreds of phones hitting the carrier or WiFi
simultaneously. Do you have relevant client experience?
Can you please:
1/ Characterize the current network performance as it relates to above.
2/ Propose options for an ideal Event tech experience
3/ Propose options for an ideal (passwordless?) event attendees experience
This is strategic not time urgent.
Thank you

Mitch
Let's figure out a way to shortcut the communication on these. Got ideas?
We have a typical kind of pattern:
There's an issue with some system. We reach out to the vendor responsible
for the camera, or the schlage locks and readers, or the building alerts,
or the video storage servers.
That vendor tells you it may have to do with the network or POE.
You tell me.
I tell TNS usually.
And we end up going back and forth without confidence that knowledgeable
people are communicating and fixing.
If it's something hot we could call an incident protocol and get both
parties on a call.
I'll also see if we can come up with easy ways for everyone to know the POE
status of every port, so the question won't need to be asked.
Let's talk it thru and figure out something.
Thanks!

Thank you.
Can you please get an authoritative list of cameras including model,
whatever we use for a location ID, and whether they require POE?
Should be able to dump this info from Genetec.
Do all the cams require POE?

Hi JP,
We realized that we have wifi access points in the ceiling in your office
on the 2nd floor. Since you are on your own network, you shouldn't been
needing them. Is there an ok time for Dan Lucus (copied on this email) to
come and grab them?

Hello Steven
For today on site, I updated 7 computers from the admin side.
I worked with Pam about setting up the Danta software for the sound system.
I switched out Angelica's old computer for Paul Kim's computer.
I took a backup of his profile and place it in box.
I worked with Mitch and Dean to determine what is needed for the Door
issues.

Hi Erika,
I hope you are doing well. I am having a bit of trouble with Box. When I
open it up in my finder it won't let me open any of the files, I have to go
to Box online in order to be able to get them to open and I realized that
some of the items aren't synced. I have been told in the past how to fix
this, but it's been so long now I can't remember.
If you could help me with that, it would be great!
Thank you so much,

TNS will handle the technical orientations for new hires as well as the
onboarding, as well as handling open tickets
Powerhouse to provide the following prior to each onsite:
List of items before each visit for our resource to complete and/or users
to submit tickets in advance of the onsite
Everything is prepared/organized when we arrive – i.e., if we need to work
on a user’s system, that system will be available

All is well and I hope the same for you. I copied support on this to review your issue below. Per Dan, Gemini is still under the Powerhouse Arts umbrella.

EXTERNAL EMAIL!!!
Hi Erika,
I hope you are doing well. I am having a bit of trouble with Box. When I open it up in my finder it won't let me open any of the files, I have to go to Box online in order to be able to get them to open and I realized that some of the items aren't synced. I
have been told in the past how to fix this, but it's been so long now I can't remember.
If you could help me with that, it would be great!
Thank you so much,
Morgan

Just a quick follow-up, Dan reached out to Yarisbeth to confirm a machine for the new hire.
The form says:
Yarisbeth informed Dan that the new hire does not need a computer.
I know this is a work in progress and we are on board. I just wanted to share some examples. Have a great weekend!

Hi David,
See below. Just FYI… the onboarding form was submitted at 1:48 today for a new hire starting on Monday. I am hoping we can change these turnarounds sooner rather than later with your help.
In addition, in terms of inventory on the form, she will need to confirm if the build is for Air or Pro.
Dan will do what he can to get this setup. Thank you, Erika

Form Submission Alert
Just a quick follow-up, Dan reached out to Yarisbeth to confirm a machine for the new hire.
The form says:
Yarisbeth informed Dan that the new hire does not need a computer.
I know this is a work in progress and we are on board. I just wanted to share some examples. Have a great weekend!

Hi David,
See below. Just FYI… the onboarding form was submitted at 1:48 today for a new hire starting on Monday. I am hoping we can change these turnarounds sooner rather than later with your help.
In addition, in terms of inventory on the form, she will need to confirm if the build is for Air or Pro.
Dan will do what he can to get this setup. Thank you, Erika

Hi Ellie!
Daniel and I will handle the "white labeling" now. One caveat, is that if
the list is dirty or if we cross a threshold of recipients flagging the
email as spam, powerhousearts.org can get put on a spam list. That's bad
and can take a few days to get rectified.

Thanks, Ellie. I agree with you on these points. I'll ask Eric in my 2pm
meeting about ticket levels & tax-deductible inclusion.

@Daniel Lucas - can you please follow the Zkipster
white-labeling steps to see if it is indeed possible with the package level
we have (similar to what I shared with you several weeks ago)? Thanks!

I believe we had attempted to do this a few weeks back, am I correct @Megan Skidmore ? It would be wonderful if we can have someone who is an administrator on the account look at the Account Settings to confirm that this has been done, as it is a best practice zkipster recommends. Article on White Labeling below: https://support.zkipster.com/en/articles/2687348-how-to-whitelabel-domains-and-email-addresses-in-zkipster Beyond that, I think we need to trust zkipster to do what it does best. I'm wary of removing too much of the brand identity in the form of images for this distribution because we want folks to be enticed to buy tickets. Further, I'm not sure how to embed images via HTML vs simply uploading using the platform's image uploader tool. The email marketing component of the program is a big selling point so I imagine they've taken care to mitigate these potential pitfalls but I'm of course mindful if anyone feels differently... There is also an interesting note at the bottom of this article on zkipsters FAQs pages that describes the issue @Sam Polcer may have been facing, e.g. the anti-spoof filter caught the email because it was indeed an outside email domain (we are not white labeled and it is showing up from an intermediary) "masquerading" as Powerhouse Arts. See article here: https://support.zkipster.com/en/articles/8467062-faqs-on-invitations All this is to say, I think we can't avoid the simple fact that some filters will catch these as spam, but if we whitelabel we should be in a better place. @Megan Skidmore - as far as distribution, I too am eager to get these out. I'll get a few more tests out to the internal comms team today with the final round edits and await the go-ahead. If we indeed need to wait for the tax deductible information, I'm happy to do so, but I am also feeling as though we need to get this out in the next few days (at the latest first thing next week) in order to best position us for success.

Catching up on this chain. @Ellie Hayworth - what are your thoughts on David's recommendations for improved layout and list sending? And can you stagger batch sending? I don't think we can get around the singular large image - looping @Jeff Quinn in here for his awareness of all, especially with consideration to the Invite design forthcoming. Eager to move this forward and ideally get it out by tomorrow.

Depending on how stringent the recipient is setup, this will result in some single digit percent getting sent to spam, I'd estimate. I think breaking up the big image is important. When I realized the HTML text was there, I took a closer look and see that there's a little bit of funkiness that could be tightened. Much more relevant is the outgoing big batch send. If we're doing that through MailChimp, then you already have experience with the list and know what to expect. If it's going out through zkipster, we should definitely do some cleaning up. Your point is interesting: did you get a message that explained it as you describe? We have local email rules that will flag messages that claim to be from someone in the Powerhouse directory but originate from a non-powerhouse address ("Eric Shiner" ).

Here are some recommendations, more or less in priority order, which will make a big difference in email deliverability. After the recommendations I include some details on my findings, just for reference. Let me know if I can help with any of this, and I'll be happy to. Recommendations Don't send the email as one big image. That's a major red flag for spam algorithms. Instead, convert it to HTML. We should be able to retain the images and great design. Include a text version of the message. When you send an email, you can include both a plaintext and an html-formatted version; in almost every case, the plaintext version is ignored and the HTML is displayed, but for our purposes it's a key factor. Include a "preheader," which is text you can put in the HTML version of the email to get displayed as a "preview" in the email reader.

Subject: Re: Save the Date | Artists Celebration Dinner | October 7

Hi All,
I did a bit of poking around and zkipster recommends that we whitelabel our
emails. I believe we had attempted to do this a few weeks back, am I
correct @Megan Skidmore ? It would be wonderful
if we can have someone who is an administrator on the account look at the
Account Settings to confirm that this has been done, as it is a best
practice zkipster recommends.
Article on White Labeling below:
https://support.zkipster.com/en/articles/2687348-how-to-whitelabel-domains-and-email-addresses-in-zkipster
Beyond that, I think we need to trust zkipster to do what it does best. I'm
wary of removing too much of the brand identity in the form of images for
this distribution because we want folks to be enticed to buy tickets.
Further, I'm not sure how to embed images via HTML vs simply uploading
using the platform's image uploader tool. The email marketing component of
the program is a big selling point so I imagine they've taken care to
mitigate these potential pitfalls but I'm of course mindful if anyone feels
differently...
There is also an interesting note at the bottom of this article on
zkipsters FAQs pages that describes the issue @Sam Polcer
may have been facing, e.g. the anti-spoof filter
caught the email because it was indeed an outside email domain (we are not
white labeled and it is showing up from an intermediary) "masquerading" as
Powerhouse Arts.
See article here:
https://support.zkipster.com/en/articles/8467062-faqs-on-invitations
All this is to say, I think we can't avoid the simple fact that some
filters will catch these as spam, but if we whitelabel we should be in a
better place.
@Megan Skidmore - as far as distribution, I too
am eager to get these out. I'll get a few more tests out to the internal
comms team today with the final round edits and await the go-ahead. If we
indeed need to wait for the tax deductible information, I'm happy to do so,
but I am also feeling as though we need to get this out in the next few
days (at the latest first thing next week) in order to best position us for
success.
Thanks,
Ellie

Hi David and Ellie,
David - this is going out through Zkipster, not Mailchimp.
Catching up on this chain. @Ellie Hayworth - what are
your thoughts on David's recommendations for improved layout and list
sending?
And can you stagger batch sending? I don't think we can get around the
singular large image - looping @Jeff Quinn in
here for his awareness of all, especially with consideration to the Invite
design forthcoming.
Eager to move this forward and ideally get it out by tomorrow. Ellie, still
awaiting Eric's response on sending with the dinner levels sans
tax-deductible portion, as we're still awaiting the final rentals cost to
factor in.
Thanks,
Megan

I take it back about the one big image. What I saw was an artifact of my
email reader; I see that your email has a big image followed by text,
including the unsubscribe link as plain text. I think the rest of what I
recommended stands, but I'd like to see it as you send it (rather than as I
received it). LMK.
Thanks

Maggie, Ellie, Sam:
I'm excited that you guys are making this event happen! Kudos.
Here are some recommendations, more or less in priority order, which will
make a big difference in email deliverability.
After the recommendations I include some details on my findings, just for
reference.
Let me know if I can help with any of this, and I'll be happy to.
*Recommendations*
- Don't send the email as one big image. That's a major red flag for
spam algorithms. Instead, convert it to HTML. We should be able to retain
the images and great design.
- Include a text version of the message. When you send an email, you can
include both a plaintext and an html-formatted version; in almost every
case, the plaintext version is ignored and the HTML is displayed, but for
our purposes it's a key factor.
- Include a "preheader," which is text you can put in the HTML version
of the email to get displayed as a "preview" in the email reader.
- If you can make the aesthetics work, put a text footer including
contact info and an unsubscribe link.
- If we have access to the recipient's name, try and make it work as
part of the subject line, content, or preheader text. "Thanks for your
pledge, Ellie! We'll see you at dinner!"
- These acknowledgements are going out one-by-one, but *even more of a
risk for spam issues is the 3,000 invitations you plan to send out*. Can
you tell me more about that, and how you plan to send it? Don't send it
before we speak, ok?
*Findings*
*A Significant Number of Incoming Test Emails Got Flagged as Suspicious*
I see seven incoming emails to powerhousearts.org from worldsbest.events in
the past seven days. Two or three of them got tagged as suspicious by
Google. I can't see exactly why they were flagged (you know: it's a machine
learning algorithm), but I have some ideas.
*Email Hygiene Looks Good*
There are a few kinds of system-level issues that can get your email
flagged as spam. On that front, the email looks good. Specifically:
- The email complies with DKIM, DMARC, SPF
,
which are anti-fraud protocols that Google and Yahoo have recently
been enforcing more stringently.
- The email uses TLS
,
which is a preferred encryption method.
- The domain passes FCrDNS ,
which protects against spammers impersonating a domain.
- The email does NOT use Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (
MTA-STS
),
which is a for encrypting messages sent between two mail servers, but I
don't think that's a relevant shortcoming for us.
- We don't support BIMI
, but that's a
nice-to-have, not a security issue. (I recommend we should do it for
marketing reasons, Sam.)
That's all positive and above-average.
Again, I think it's an exciting and important thing you're doing for PHA;
really! Let me know however I can.
Cheers

Hi David,
The worldsbest domain is registered through Zkipster, our event marketing
platform utilized to send email marketing and invitations, in addition to
RSVP tracking and other event marketing needs.
You may be able to see what has been posted in their FAQs section and/or
there may be some threads about others contending with this issue. The
highest level subscription allows for full domain integration but I don’t
believe that is the case in the mid tier.
I hope this is helpful and we appreciate your insights and attention to
this! We are aiming to get the save the dates out asap this week.
Best,
Ellie

Hi Erika,
This time works for me as long as Rob has enough time prior to 5:00p to make his checks and do whatever work that needs to be done of all the equipment around the building.
Please remember that Powerhouse Arts will be on the electric provided from the generator from 5:15p - 6:15p, at 6:15p I will switch back to the normal Con Ed electric. Rob will need to go around the building again I assume to check all the equipment after the return to normal power ?
Thanks,
Mitch
Hi Mitch,
I wanted to confirm that Rob will be onsite on 11/21 at 430 pm for the Generator Test. Please confirm that this timing works for you and let me know if you have any questions.
Please advise. Thanks, Erika

Hi Mitch,
I had Rob review the following – everything before that looked good
I will be sending an email out to the Powerhouse Arts staff soon to tell them to turn off their computers 15 minutes prior to the start of the online generator test, shall I have them unplug them too ?
Rob’s Response:
I am fine with that statement. If they unplug, they will need to remember to plug back in the following day or when the power testing is completed
As mentioned, I will be able to confirm the onsite with Rob by mid-week, next week.
Please let me know if you need anything further. Than you, Erika

Hi Erica,
On Tuesday November 21 @ 5:15p along with my vendor I will be conducting an online generator test. This is when we turn off the electricity to the building and the electricity is restored to the building from the generator. As you know when the electricity is restored this can sometimes cause problems to sensitive equipment such as the servers due to the surge. I will be sending an email out to the Powerhouse Arts staff soon to tell them to turn off their computers 15 minutes prior to the start of the online generator test, shall I have them unplug them too ? Additionally, I think I should have a TNS tech on site during this time to check the UPS and in case something goes wrong as I plan to reopen the building at 7:00p since we are open during the week until 10:00p.
Any recommendations for this online generator test and how we shall proceed ?
Thank you in advance,
Mitch

Hi TNS Group (Omega?) Is there an Omega email we should be addressing?
Can you add a second phone to the 4th floor print shop (same number as the
existing print shop phone) on the West side of the floor with the volume
set to the highest setting so Luther can hear it over the machines?
Let us know what you need from us to do so. Thanks!

Hi Luther, thanks for sharing your concerns while on vacation, and I'm
sorry you can't hear the phone across the room.
1, we should add a second phone to the other end of the print shop so you
can be alerted when visitors and deliveries have arrived. I'll push this to
IT/Omega (fka TNS)
2, you can cc group_security when scheduling visits
3, you can also *call* the security desk to let them know you are expecting
a visitor so that they are not turned away
We don't want to make this more difficult for you! Flagging things like the
phone being too far away are easily solved, and we should build
tools/systems that make everything easier for your workflow.

A telephone call means someone needs to stop fabricating, wash their hands or take off their PPE to answer a phone and they have to do it in the incredibly short amount of time that our phone system rings. Before I left Mitch tried to call the printshop repeatedly but we couldn’t hear him over the machines. He never reached me or the printshop staff and our delivery agent had to call tour customer and they had to send and email to reach us. I appreciate you trying to get the gate house to do their job. However I feel this approach is flawed and now has me running the full length of the build to reach a phone that I can barely hear and that I will always have to have my cellphone on me or stand by it while it’s being charged. If this is going to work I will need a permanent fix to the flawed our phone system. Yes I am on vacation and that’s how much I care about this issue. L On Thu, Aug 1, 2024 at 8:46 PM Julia Margaret Lu wrote: Good Afternoon Colleagues, Over the past few weeks there have been some conflicts with visitors at the gatehouse on why they are being detained when this didn't happen before. In the past the gatehouse security guards were not doing their jobs and they were just letting everybody through. Mitch and I have been cracking down on security to keep everyone and our facility safe. To reduce the conflicts at the gatehouse for visitors please see the security protocols for guests, vendors, and special deliveries: There are 2 ways for vehicular guests to gain access to Powerhouse Arts: 1. Email the security team in advance at group_security@powerhousearts.org and state the following : Name of the person Date and time expected Include parking accommodations (Garage or Forecourt) The security team will see this email and grant access to the visitor when they arrive. 2. Unannounced/unexpected visitors: If a guest shows up at the gatehouse the security protocol is to ask them for a contact person. The security team has a staff list with phone numbers for Powerhouse Arts, Workspace 11, Alpha Workshops, and Manhattan Graphics Center. The gatehouse security guard will call that person to verify if they should be granted access to the Powerhouse Arts building. Please share this protocol with your guests, vendors and for deliveries. Additionally, please provide a backup contact if you potentially might not be available and be mindful that if you do not answer your phone from the security team there could be a delay. If the security team isn't able to connect with the contact person then they will then be required to contact the engineering department so they can then find the contact person. As a reminder, visitors and visiting artists may request parking, but Ceramics members are limited to Forecourt parking only when loading and unloading. THANK YOU for your continued cooperation and dedication to keeping Powerhouse safe :) Please email Mitch and I directly if you have any questions/concerns. - Julia + Mitch -- Julia Margaret Lu (she/her) Operations Manager Powerhouse Arts Find a time to meet with Julia julia@powerhousearts.org cell (917) 304 9528 322 Third Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11215 www.powerhousearts.org

Daniel and David,
Webroot security was somehow reinstalled or reactivated on our dedicated PC
for outputting film.
Unfortunately this computer's purpose is to run one software subscription
that needs to be activated Jan1 of each year. Now I cannot do so without
this webroot being removed.
Please let me know how we can get this sorted out. I am under some
deadlines and this is problematic.
Thanks

Thank you!
So if I have it right, all of our Meraki licenses are expiring 6/21/2025,
and the Estimated Extended Cost is a guess at the 3-year license renewal
cost, assuming nothing changes.
Does that mean we are paid up through the expiration date, or are we still
paying down the current Meraki licenses on a monthly basis?
We can speak tomorrow.
I hope you're getting some relief from the back issue.

Hi David,
See below. I am more than happy to discuss through this tomorrow during our meeting. Many thanks, Erika
Estimated Cost:
Estimated cost for each unit/device All renewals for support (subscriptions) are subject to change per the vendor – TNS does not have any control over that We pull the data that is available from the vendor and if it is not available, we look at past trends to estimate the cost
Estimated Extended Cost:
The cost Estimated is the total of Estimated Cost x quantity Cost multiplied by quantity to provide the full cost for the renewal, per term.
Term Estimated
A vendor can change the term of a renewal term at any time, for example, if a 3-year term was offered in the past, they may have a reason to pull it
and only provide a 1-year term – TNS does not have control over this (it is usually a specific situation that this would change)
1-year or 3-year
This is the life of the renewal. The equipment subscription is in place for 1 year or 3 years pending term. If it is a 3-year term, you will not renew
the subscriptions/renewals until 3 years later.
Expiration Date
That is when your current renewal/subscription expires. TNS sends out quotes 30-60 days in advance of the expiration date to maintain support on the
devices. Also, if Meraki support is not renewed, Meraki will shut down the devices, so they are no longer live in your environment.
For example:
Wireless Access Point – MR Enterprise: Renewal cost for support is $283/device, multiplied by a quantity of 70 devices = $19,810. Powerhouse will need to review your current subscriptions for support by
6/21/2025.
From there, Powerhouse will not pay for these subscriptions until the renewal is up in 3 years.

For instance, the MS1208FP @ $100 is for what? Meraki license for... 1 year? 3 years?

Good morning,
I went back to the Dr. this morning and unfortunately, I am not able to travel and sit for the day. I am so sorry; this came on so quicky and it
is a challenge.
May we schedule a Zoom meeting for tomorrow? Dan will already be onsite. Rob and I are more than happy to visit in May if that works. We can hold
one of our weekly meetings in person next month or we can reconvene in Q3 for the onsite.
We will do whatever is best for Powerhouse.
I welcome your thoughts and I appreciate your understanding, Erika

Oh no! I hope you're ok and starting to feel better. We have to take care of, and put our, health and bodies first - of course this is OK. We can do a Zoom this time if you're
unable to travel - just keep us posted.

Hi Steven,
We are scheduled to be onsite. We love to visit Powerhouse
I do need to share that I pulled out my back on Sunday and am actively trying to do all that is needed to get the issue under control.
If it does not get better, I am not sure if I am going to make it. I don’t want to ever disappoint. If that is the case, can we plan an onsite in
May?
I welcome your thoughts here. Thank you and my sincere apologies, Erika

Hi Steven,
Cost Projections as requested:
Additional Users:
Powerhouse contracts supports 60 users.
For 5 additional users to 15 users, the pricing will be $125/user/month with a few caveats:
The $125/user/month is based on the current environment. When we spec out our Total Care services (Managed Services) we consider and incorporate all the hardware that we manage and users as well.
If your equipment remains the same, and you are not adding another 10 switches (as example) we are safe with the $125/user per month
Unless any processes change, I will not uplift or increase the contract for 5 users, it would start at 10 additional.
Security Components:
Managed Detection Response (EDR) with AMTD (Automated Moving Target Defense - see attached
This solution is based on the number of devices – I used 94 devices based on what is in your environment now. If devices go up or down, the pricing will change.
EDR AMTD
94 X $11.50 = $1,081.00 (monthly pricing)
One-Time Setup $999
CAT+ (Phish Testing and Security Awareness Training)
This is based on users – I used 75 below
75 X $3.25 = $243.75 (Monthly pricing)
Setup $999 (One-time setup)
Lastly, Dan sent over the warranty report for systems to David. I put in a request for the renewal budget and should have that no later than mid-week
next week, if not sooner.
Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything further.
Have a great weekend and I look forward to seeing you next Wednesday! Erika

Thanks for this. Can you give us rough budget numbers so we can add a line item for these for budget inclusion, and then we can go ahead and schedule the TBR asap? I'd like to
sit in on that -

Hi Steven,
As a quick follow-up, we would like to continue to have discussions with Powerhouse about security solutions for your organization over time. Our
role is to educate our clients on our security stacks so we can create a base layer. I would also like to schedule a Technical Business Review (TBR) with David as we have done in the past. I will speak to David further so we can determine timing.
I am not sure if you have the liberty to maintain a “bucket” in the budget for security layers.
Just a thought as most of our clients are going in that direction, specifically for:
Endpoint Detection Response (EDR)- Smart Guard
Security Awareness Training (SAT) – phish testing and training
We have discussed these in the past, except for Smart Guard. This will take time as we want you and David to have clear understanding of any security
solutions we would recommend.
Just a thought. I welcome your feedback, Erika

Thanks, Erika. We're equally excited and thankful for our partnership.
Our next FY begins July 1 (July 1 - June 30), and the end of this week/next week is OK.
In terms of the growth, the majority of those folks will be administrative roles (some fabricators), with the hardware growth being desktops (95% of these new roles will be on Macs),
accessories, monitors, etc. I don't think there's much growth we'll see on the infrastructure side yet, but want @David Koosis to chime in.

Hi David,
See below. I am more than happy to discuss through this tomorrow during our meeting. Many thanks, Erika
Estimated Cost:
* Estimated cost for each unit/device
* All renewals for support (subscriptions) are subject to change per the vendor – TNS does not have any control over that
* We pull the data that is available from the vendor and if it is not available, we look at past trends to estimate the cost
Estimated Extended Cost:
* The cost Estimated is the total of Estimated Cost x quantity Cost multiplied by quantity to provide the full cost for the renewal, per term.
Term Estimated
* A vendor can change the term of a renewal term at any time, for example, if a 3-year term was offered in the past, they may have a reason to pull it and only provide a 1-year term – TNS does not have control over this (it is usually a specific situation that this would change)
1-year or 3-year
* This is the life of the renewal. The equipment subscription is in place for 1 year or 3 years pending term. If it is a 3-year term, you will not renew the subscriptions/renewals until 3 years later.
Expiration Date
* That is when your current renewal/subscription expires. TNS sends out quotes 30-60 days in advance of the expiration date to maintain support on the devices. Also, if Meraki support is not renewed, Meraki will shut down the devices, so they are no longer live in your environment.
For example:
Wireless Access Point – MR Enterprise: Renewal cost for support is $283/device, multiplied by a quantity of 70 devices = $19,810. Powerhouse will need to review your current subscriptions for support by 6/21/2025.

So sorry about your back, Erika! That stinks! Of course a zoom meeting tomorrow is good, and we'll aim for in person May.
I'll take a look at what you've sent.

Good morning,
I went back to the Dr. this morning and unfortunately, I am not able to travel and sit for the day. I am so sorry; this came on so quicky and it
is a challenge.
May we schedule a Zoom meeting for tomorrow? Dan will already be onsite. Rob and I are more than happy to visit in May if that works. We can hold
one of our weekly meetings in person next month or we can reconvene in Q3 for the onsite.
We will do whatever is best for Powerhouse.
I welcome your thoughts and I appreciate your understanding, Erika

Oh no! I hope you're ok and starting to feel better. We have to take care of, and put our, health and bodies first - of course this is OK. We can do a Zoom this time if you're
unable to travel - just keep us posted.

Hi Steven,
We are scheduled to be onsite. We love to visit Powerhouse
I do need to share that I pulled out my back on Sunday and am actively trying to do all that is needed to get the issue under control.
If it does not get better, I am not sure if I am going to make it. I don’t want to ever disappoint. If that is the case, can we plan an onsite in
May?
I welcome your thoughts here. Thank you and my sincere apologies, Erika

Hi Steven,
Cost Projections as requested:
Additional Users:
Powerhouse contracts supports 60 users.
For 5 additional users to 15 users, the pricing will be $125/user/month with a few caveats:
The $125/user/month is based on the current environment. When we spec out our Total Care services (Managed Services) we consider and incorporate all the hardware that we manage and users as well.
If your equipment remains the same, and you are not adding another 10 switches (as example) we are safe with the $125/user per month
Unless any processes change, I will not uplift or increase the contract for 5 users, it would start at 10 additional.
Security Components:
Managed Detection Response (EDR) with AMTD (Automated Moving Target Defense - see attached
This solution is based on the number of devices – I used 94 devices based on what is in your environment now. If devices go up or down, the pricing will change.
EDR AMTD
94 X $11.50 = $1,081.00 (monthly pricing)
One-Time Setup $999
CAT+ (Phish Testing and Security Awareness Training)
This is based on users – I used 75 below
75 X $3.25 = $243.75 (Monthly pricing)
Setup $999 (One-time setup)
Lastly, Dan sent over the warranty report for systems to David. I put in a request for the renewal budget and should have that no later than mid-week
next week, if not sooner.
Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything further.
Have a great weekend and I look forward to seeing you next Wednesday! Erika

Hi Erika,
Thanks for this. Can you give us rough budget numbers so we can add a line item for these for budget inclusion, and then we can go ahead and schedule the TBR asap? I'd like to
sit in on that -

Hi Steven,
As a quick follow-up, we would like to continue to have discussions with Powerhouse about security solutions for your organization over time. Our
role is to educate our clients on our security stacks so we can create a base layer. I would also like to schedule a Technical Business Review (TBR) with David as we have done in the past. I will speak to David further so we can determine timing.
I am not sure if you have the liberty to maintain a “bucket” in the budget for security layers.
Just a thought as most of our clients are going in that direction, specifically for:
Endpoint Detection Response (EDR)- Smart Guard
Security Awareness Training (SAT) – phish testing and training
We have discussed these in the past, except for Smart Guard. This will take time as we want you and David to have clear understanding of any security
solutions we would recommend.
Just a thought. I welcome your feedback, Erika

Thanks, Erika. We're equally excited and thankful for our partnership.
Our next FY begins July 1 (July 1 - June 30), and the end of this week/next week is OK.
In terms of the growth, the majority of those folks will be administrative roles (some fabricators), with the hardware growth being desktops (95% of these new roles will be on Macs),
accessories, monitors, etc. I don't think there's much growth we'll see on the infrastructure side yet, but want @David Koosis to chime in.

Hi Erika,
Thanks for this. Can you give us rough budget numbers so we can add a line item for these for budget inclusion, and then we can go ahead and schedule the TBR asap? I'd like to sit in on that -

Hi Steven,
As a quick follow-up, we would like to continue to have discussions with Powerhouse about security solutions for your organization over time. Our role is to educate our clients on our security stacks so we can create a base layer. I would also like to schedule a Technical Business Review (TBR) with David as we have done in the past. I will speak to David further so we can determine timing.
I am not sure if you have the liberty to maintain a “bucket” in the budget for security layers.
Just a thought as most of our clients are going in that direction, specifically for:
* Endpoint Detection Response (EDR)- Smart Guard
* Security Awareness Training (SAT) – phish testing and training
We have discussed these in the past, except for Smart Guard. This will take time as we want you and David to have clear understanding of any security solutions we would recommend.
Just a thought. I welcome your feedback, Erika

Thanks, Erika. We're equally excited and thankful for our partnership.
Our next FY begins July 1 (July 1 - June 30), and the end of this week/next week is OK.
In terms of the growth, the majority of those folks will be administrative roles (some fabricators), with the hardware growth being desktops (95% of these new roles will be on Macs), accessories, monitors, etc. I don't think there's much growth we'll see on the infrastructure side yet, but want @David Koosis to chime in.

Hi Steven,
Congratulations – Powerhouse keeps on growing and evolving – so exciting to be part of it!
No problem – what is the timeframe to get this back to you? Would be end of week, next week work?
Will you just be adding users, not infrastructure?
Is your FY July 1? Thank you, Erika

Erika,
Hope you're having a great week so far. We're in a budgeting cycle for our next fiscal year - could you provide a rough budget estimate for when we grow to 65 and 75 staff, respectively?
Thanks,
Steven

May we schedule a Zoom meeting for tomorrow? Dan will already be onsite. Rob and I are more than happy to visit in May if that works. We can hold
one of our weekly meetings in person next month or we can reconvene in Q3 for the onsite.
We will do whatever is best for Powerhouse.

I do need to share that I pulled out my back on Sunday and am actively trying to do all that is needed to get the issue under control.
If it does not get better, I am not sure if I am going to make it. I don’t want to ever disappoint. If that is the case, can we plan an onsite in
May?
I welcome your thoughts here. Thank you and my sincere apologies, Erika

Hi Steven,
Cost Projections as requested:
Additional Users:
Powerhouse contracts supports 60 users.
For 5 additional users to 15 users, the pricing will be $125/user/month with a few caveats:
The $125/user/month is based on the current environment. When we spec out our Total Care services (Managed Services) we consider and incorporate all the hardware that we manage and users as well.
If your equipment remains the same, and you are not adding another 10 switches (as example) we are safe with the $125/user per month
Unless any processes change, I will not uplift or increase the contract for 5 users, it would start at 10 additional.
Security Components:
Managed Detection Response (EDR) with AMTD (Automated Moving Target Defense - see attached
This solution is based on the number of devices – I used 94 devices based on what is in your environment now. If devices go up or down, the pricing will change.
EDR AMTD
94 X $11.50 = $1,081.00 (monthly pricing)
One-Time Setup $999
CAT+ (Phish Testing and Security Awareness Training)
This is based on users – I used 75 below
75 X $3.25 = $243.75 (Monthly pricing)
Setup $999 (One-time setup)
Lastly, Dan sent over the warranty report for systems to David. I put in a request for the renewal budget and should have that no later than mid-week
next week, if not sooner.
Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything further.
Have a great weekend and I look forward to seeing you next Wednesday! Erika

Lastly, Dan sent over the warranty report for systems to David. I put in a request for the renewal budget and should have that no later than mid-week next week, if not sooner.
Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything further.
Have a great weekend and I look forward to seeing you next Wednesday! Erika

Hi Erika,
Thanks for this. Can you give us rough budget numbers so we can add a line item for these for budget inclusion, and then we can go ahead and schedule the TBR asap? I'd like to sit in on that -

Hi Steven,
As a quick follow-up, we would like to continue to have discussions with Powerhouse about security solutions for your organization over time. Our role is to educate our clients on our security stacks so we can create a base layer. I would also like to schedule a Technical Business Review (TBR) with David as we have done in the past. I will speak to David further so we can determine timing.
I am not sure if you have the liberty to maintain a “bucket” in the budget for security layers.
Just a thought as most of our clients are going in that direction, specifically for:
* Endpoint Detection Response (EDR)- Smart Guard
* Security Awareness Training (SAT) – phish testing and training
We have discussed these in the past, except for Smart Guard. This will take time as we want you and David to have clear understanding of any security solutions we would recommend.
Just a thought. I welcome your feedback, Erika

Thanks, Erika. We're equally excited and thankful for our partnership.
Our next FY begins July 1 (July 1 - June 30), and the end of this week/next week is OK.
In terms of the growth, the majority of those folks will be administrative roles (some fabricators), with the hardware growth being desktops (95% of these new roles will be on Macs), accessories, monitors, etc. I don't think there's much growth we'll see on the infrastructure side yet, but want @David Koosis to chime in.

Hi Steven,
Congratulations – Powerhouse keeps on growing and evolving – so exciting to be part of it!
No problem – what is the timeframe to get this back to you? Would be end of week, next week work?
Will you just be adding users, not infrastructure?
Is your FY July 1? Thank you, Erika

Erika,
Hope you're having a great week so far. We're in a budgeting cycle for our next fiscal year - could you provide a rough budget estimate for when we grow to 65 and 75 staff, respectively?
Thanks,

Good morning,
I went back to the Dr. this morning and unfortunately, I am not able to travel and sit for the day. I am so sorry; this came on so quicky and it is a challenge.
May we schedule a Zoom meeting for tomorrow? Dan will already be onsite. Rob and I are more than happy to visit in May if that works. We can hold one of our weekly meetings in person next month or we can
reconvene in Q3 for the onsite.
We will do whatever is best for Powerhouse.
I welcome your thoughts and I appreciate your understanding, Erika

I do need to share that I pulled out my back on Sunday and am actively trying to do all that is needed to get the issue under control.
If it does not get better, I am not sure if I am going to make it. I don’t want to ever disappoint. If that is the case, can we plan an onsite in
May?
I welcome your thoughts here. Thank you and my sincere apologies, Erika

Hi Steven,
Cost Projections as requested:
Additional Users:
Powerhouse contracts supports 60 users.
For 5 additional users to 15 users, the pricing will be $125/user/month with a few caveats:
The $125/user/month is based on the current environment. When we spec out our Total Care services (Managed Services) we consider and incorporate all the hardware that we manage and users as well.
If your equipment remains the same, and you are not adding another 10 switches (as example) we are safe with the $125/user per month
Unless any processes change, I will not uplift or increase the contract for 5 users, it would start at 10 additional.
Security Components:
Managed Detection Response (EDR) with AMTD (Automated Moving Target Defense - see attached
This solution is based on the number of devices – I used 94 devices based on what is in your environment now. If devices go up or down, the pricing will change.
EDR AMTD
94 X $11.50 = $1,081.00 (monthly pricing)
One-Time Setup $999
CAT+ (Phish Testing and Security Awareness Training)
This is based on users – I used 75 below
75 X $3.25 = $243.75 (Monthly pricing)
Setup $999 (One-time setup)

Hi Erika,
Thanks for this. Can you give us rough budget numbers so we can add a line item for these for budget inclusion, and then we can go ahead and schedule the TBR asap? I'd like to
sit in on that -

Hi Steven,
As a quick follow-up, we would like to continue to have discussions with Powerhouse about security solutions for your organization over time. Our
role is to educate our clients on our security stacks so we can create a base layer. I would also like to schedule a Technical Business Review (TBR) with David as we have done in the past. I will speak to David further so we can determine timing.
I am not sure if you have the liberty to maintain a “bucket” in the budget for security layers.
Just a thought as most of our clients are going in that direction, specifically for:
Endpoint Detection Response (EDR)- Smart Guard
Security Awareness Training (SAT) – phish testing and training
We have discussed these in the past, except for Smart Guard. This will take time as we want you and David to have clear understanding of any security
solutions we would recommend.
Just a thought. I welcome your feedback, Erika

Thanks, Erika. We're equally excited and thankful for our partnership.
Our next FY begins July 1 (July 1 - June 30), and the end of this week/next week is OK.
In terms of the growth, the majority of those folks will be administrative roles (some fabricators), with the hardware growth being desktops (95% of these new roles will be on Macs),
accessories, monitors, etc. I don't think there's much growth we'll see on the infrastructure side yet, but want @David Koosis to chime in.

No problem – what is the timeframe to get this back to you? Would be end of week, next week work?
Will you just be adding users, not infrastructure?
Is your FY July 1? Thank you, Erika

Hi Steven,
Cost Projections as requested:
Additional Users:
Powerhouse contracts supports 60 users.
For 5 additional users to 15 users, the pricing will be $125/user/month with a few caveats:
The $125/user/month is based on the current environment. When we spec out our Total Care services (Managed Services) we consider and incorporate all the hardware that we manage and users as well.
If your equipment remains the same, and you are not adding another 10 switches (as example) we are safe with the $125/user per month
Unless any processes change, I will not uplift or increase the contract for 5 users, it would start at 10 additional.
Security Components:
Managed Detection Response (EDR) with AMTD (Automated Moving Target Defense - see attached
This solution is based on the number of devices – I used 94 devices based on what is in your environment now. If devices go up or down, the pricing will change.
EDR AMTD
94 X $11.50 = $1,081.00 (monthly pricing)
One-Time Setup $999
CAT+ (Phish Testing and Security Awareness Training)
This is based on users – I used 75 below
75 X $3.25 = $243.75 (Monthly pricing)
Setup $999 (One-time setup)
Lastly, Dan sent over the warranty report for systems to David. I put in a request for the renewal budget and should have that no later than mid-week
next week, if not sooner.
Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything further.
Have a great weekend and I look forward to seeing you next Wednesday! Erika

Hi Steven,
Cost Projections as requested:
Additional Users:
Powerhouse contracts supports 60 users. For 5 additional users to 15 users, the pricing will be $125/user/month with a few caveats:
The $125/user/month is based on the current environment. When we spec out our Total Care services (Managed Services) we consider and incorporate all the hardware that we manage and
users as well.
If your equipment remains the same, and you are not adding another 10 switches (as example) we are safe with the $125/user per month
Unless any processes change, I will not uplift or increase the contract for 5 users, it would start at 10 additional.
Security Components:
Managed Detection Response (EDR) with AMTD (Automated Moving Target Defense - see attached
This solution is based on the number of devices – I used 94 devices based on what is in your environment now. If devices go up or down, the pricing will change.
EDR AMTD
94 X $11.50 = $1,081.00 (monthly pricing)
One-Time Setup $999
CAT+ (Phish Testing and Security Awareness Training)
This is based on users – I used 75 below
75 X $3.25 = $243.75 (Monthly pricing)
Setup $999 (One-time setup)
Lastly, Dan sent over the warranty report for systems to David. I put in a request for the renewal budget and should have that no later than mid-week next week, if not sooner.
Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything further.
Have a great weekend and I look forward to seeing you next Wednesday! Erika

Hi Erika,
Thanks for this. Can you give us rough budget numbers so we can add a line item for these for budget inclusion, and then we can go ahead and schedule the TBR asap? I'd like to
sit in on that -

Hi Steven,
As a quick follow-up, we would like to continue to have discussions with Powerhouse about security solutions for your organization over time. Our
role is to educate our clients on our security stacks so we can create a base layer. I would also like to schedule a Technical Business Review (TBR) with David as we have done in the past. I will speak to David further so we can determine timing.
I am not sure if you have the liberty to maintain a “bucket” in the budget for security layers.
Just a thought as most of our clients are going in that direction, specifically for:
Endpoint Detection Response (EDR)- Smart Guard
Security Awareness Training (SAT) – phish testing and training
We have discussed these in the past, except for Smart Guard. This will take time as we want you and David to have clear understanding of any security
solutions we would recommend.
Just a thought. I welcome your feedback, Erika

Thanks, Erika. We're equally excited and thankful for our partnership.
Our next FY begins July 1 (July 1 - June 30), and the end of this week/next week is OK.
In terms of the growth, the majority of those folks will be administrative roles (some fabricators), with the hardware growth being desktops (95% of these new roles will be on Macs),
accessories, monitors, etc. I don't think there's much growth we'll see on the infrastructure side yet, but want @David Koosis to chime in.

Erika,
Hope you're having a great week so far. We're in a budgeting cycle for our next fiscal year - could you provide a rough budget estimate for when we grow to 65 and 75 staff, respectively?
Thanks,

Erika,
Hope you're having a great week so far. We're in a budgeting cycle for our next fiscal year - could you provide a rough budget estimate for when we grow to 65 and 75 staff, respectively?
Thanks,
Steven

Hi Erika,
Thanks for this. Can you give us rough budget numbers so we can add a line item for these for budget inclusion, and then we can go ahead and schedule the TBR asap? I'd like to sit in on that -

Hi Steven,
As a quick follow-up, we would like to continue to have discussions with Powerhouse about security solutions for your organization over time. Our
role is to educate our clients on our security stacks so we can create a base layer. I would also like to schedule a Technical Business Review (TBR) with David as we have done in the past. I will speak to David further so we can determine timing.
I am not sure if you have the liberty to maintain a “bucket” in the budget for security layers.
Just a thought as most of our clients are going in that direction, specifically for:
Endpoint Detection Response (EDR)- Smart Guard
Security Awareness Training (SAT) – phish testing and training
We have discussed these in the past, except for Smart Guard. This will take time as we want you and David to have clear understanding of any security
solutions we would recommend.
Just a thought. I welcome your feedback, Erika

Thanks, Erika. We're equally excited and thankful for our partnership.
Our next FY begins July 1 (July 1 - June 30), and the end of this week/next week is OK.
In terms of the growth, the majority of those folks will be administrative roles (some fabricators), with the hardware growth being desktops (95% of these new roles will be on Macs),
accessories, monitors, etc. I don't think there's much growth we'll see on the infrastructure side yet, but want @David Koosis to chime in.

Hi Steven,
What a great meeting yesterday – it was so nice to meet David and person and discuss as a group.
As mentioned, attached is the monthly services page from Powerhouse’s current contract. This shows the uplift of $3,000 to include a total of 60 users under the agreement.
Please print out the attached and on this page, please handwritten write -
Approved with your initials
and scan it back.
I thought it would be best to initial the page rather than start a new contract. With so many thing changes on both sides, I wanted to make this as simple as possible.
As discussed, this billing will start on 2/1/23.
Please let me know if you have any questions. Many thanks, Erika

Thank you for the picture. You're right that is strange. I have checked Zoom just now - only Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa. Was Lisa Dent added to PHA x MGC meeting back in the day? This can be cached previously. But so far Lisa Archigian, email and Zoom

Dear Interns,
Welcome! I know my colleagues are really to have you here.
None of you benefitted from a formal introduction to the software tools we
use here at Powerhouse.
I'd like to rectify that if it is helpful. Can you:
- Please confirm whether you have access to the software you need, or
reply to this email to let me know otherwise. Your supervisors will know
which tools are relevant to your work.
- Consult with your supervisor and let me know if it would be helpful to
schedule an introductory training session to any of the software we use.
- In the meantime, if you need help with anything tech related, send an
email to helpdesk@powerhousearts.org including your phone number, and
our external helpdesk team will assist.
Thank you

Hi David,
Yes, Dan is familiar, he and I had this conversation about updating DNS for website relaunch, I'm just verifying that he's available today.
We're just using Mailchimp email, not landing pages. We had to do some stuff to get us authenticated, but I'm thinking since we did that already, we won't need to do it again. I'm not sure, however.
The site is hosted on Kinsta. I'll ping you when it's go time. I think they're well familiar with whatever checklist exists and are just going to let us know when they need something, but it can't hurt to have some eyes on it.

Hello Sam:
Awesome news about the launch!
Regarding DNS info, it's a great question. It may be a painless switch, but often there are dependencies which need to be checked to prevent things from breaking.
Hopefully Dan or someone else is familiar with your setup.
Are you using Mailchimp landing pages, or just email? My recollection is that email won't be impacted but landing pages will.
I'd ask the web developers and/or check the hosting service to give you a launch checklist related to network configuration.
Do you know where the site is hosted, and whether you've got it behind a caching or security service, such as Cloudflare?
I'll be in the office tomorrow and happy to jump on a call if I can be helpful.

Giving you the heads up that we're planning on launching the new website tomorrow, which means that our web developers will be giving us DNS info to input. Hopefully you'll be able to do this?

Also- will this affect authentication for our MailChimp account?

FYI, TNS handled this last time, and it was a bit of a mess due to
Cornershop not being clear and not wanting to talk directly to TNS. Oh,
and one day’s notice to TNS for DNS changes isn’t ideal, although, as you
know, it only takes a few min to actually make the change. And, btw, since
Cornershop hosts the interim site, why don’t they just change IPs, and
avoid any DNS changes at all?

Hi Dan,
Hope you're well.
Giving you the heads up that we're planning on launching the new website
tomorrow, which means that our web developers will be giving us DNS info to
input. Hopefully you'll be able to do this?
Please let me know windows of availability.

Hi David,
First, thank you for your candid response – I truly appreciate the open communication.
Our clients are of our utmost importance. My apologies that our discussion came across as a disappointment. I looked at the discussion a little differently, but regardless, your perception is what matters.
We are a committed partner to Powerhouse and want to do all that we can to move things forward. We just want to make sure that our clients have the parameters as to what we are capable and what we are not. Perhaps we overstated that. During the call Rob stated that we can take it on and outlined that we can monitor the device for connectivity and provide OS upgrades for security purposes. I thought we agreed on this but should have closed the loop.
Rob, Steve, and I jumped on a call when I got your email. We all agreed that all your bullet points are correct, and things that we can do from a service standpoint. If you still want TNS to spec out the device, we will go ahead and do so unless you prefer to do so on your side. Just let me know and I will stop the process internally.
In terms of “the open to the IIS” – can you provide more details on this? We manage/”own” the network and always want Powerhouse to ensure the security of it. We need to reinforce the importance of any 3rd party vendors that want to make changes on the network to go through TNS (always copy Rob and myself). That way we can assess the situation and provide the pros/cons from a security perspective so Powerhouse can make a business decision if you agree. I was going to put this on our agenda for our monthly meeting.
Lastly, in terms of your taking on the initiative to determine where the lines are between vendors, we appreciate it. Our intent was to provide those lines in these types of situations, while sharing what we can do.
Again, thank you for your feedback so we can continue to strengthen our partnership. I am available tomorrow if you want to jump on a call.
Warm regards, Erika

Hi Erika!
Because it's best for our partnership if I am direct and transparent, I'll tell you I was disappointed with our conversation.
Instead of offering solutions or telling me that server management is not something you provide, you explained the challenges of being a managed service provider.
I understand the constraints and concerns you referenced, and I've worked through these kinds of issues lots of times, as I thought you guys had too.
I was expecting your response when you called might have been something like:
David:
* We don't work with NUC's much, but we're very familiar with Dell 1Us. Since you said equivalent specs would be fine, we propose a Dell 1U, which costs a little more -- $xxx -- and works well with our management tools.
* Our server management service costs XXX and includes keeping the OS and firmware patched at a level recommended by Microsoft to protect against critical level security issues.
* We can also keep some other common software -- like web servers -- up-to-date if you choose.
* If application software running on the server requires specific conditions -- such as ports which must be open, or software systems which should NOT be patched, we can usually respect those requirements.
* We can monitor the health of the server and its network connectivity.
* HOWEVER: We can not be responsible for the proper functioning of application software running on the server.
* In order to make this work, we need to agree on a protocol for triaging and handling issues that come up.
In general, we can provide a server healthcheck at any time by checking the dashboard or XXXX. If the server healthcheck shows that the server is running and reachable on the network, then PHA must route any problems using the application to the application software vendor. We can refine this protocol collaboratively.
---
I am on your side, working to have TNS valued as a highly skilled strategic partner. I hope you understand my feedback and have the support you need internally to improve our future conversations.
Let me know if this makes sense to you, or if we're seeing things differently.
Thank you

Hello,
The Mac desktop at the front desk in the lobby won't turn on even though it is fully plugged in. It is connected to an extension cord which is working for an iPhone charge cable. I have tried to turn it on by holding the power button for 10 seconds and also
in Safe Mode, neither of which worked.
It was working perfectly fine when I left work yesterday evening.
Please let me know what I should try next.

Notes - Tech @ Gatehouse Convo https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BPFPUHlbgZ0oSUGjqu-XxPgGagGUoObrJq4_Rt1APiI/edit
Question:What's the current status in the gatehouse?There's a Genetec-dedicated PC (who manages it?) and 3 dual-port RJ 45 wall plates. 1 plate has the Genetec PC + a phone plugged in. A 2nd plate has an additional phone plugged in. How many network runs are going to the gatehouse and how many jacks are live?The idea behind the wireless camera is, I'm told, so that the security company can monitor their employee. It's a WiFi cam not connected to the Genetec surveillance system. Correct?

Per Steven:
On google calendar, please change the default settings so that Guests can
Modify events (including changing the times).
I think this is not a standard Admin-configurable setting, so it might
require some way of setting it when it gets pushed, if that's possible.

*Mislabeling of 'Ceramics' Phones* – There are multiple phones labeled
as ‘Ceramics’, or similar, but none seem to be properly connected to the
studio or anywhere else. This is causing additional confusion, and it would
be great if we could ensure the proper labeling and routing for all phones.

Could we get these issues resolved as soon as possible? Please let me know

Hi guys,
Just forwarding for recording keeping purposes. Looks to be some snafus with DNS records between Cornershop and TNS. (I put Cornershop in touch with Dan at TNS on Wednesday; they had to input DNS records to make our site live.)

My developer is saying that you will need to contact your DNS provider support, because the servers are reporting to the internet that that record exists somewhere and is causing problems.

Sam & Dan,
Hi! We are noticing a long series of site outages. After attempting to fix the issue, we have confirmed there was a mistake in deleting and inputting the new IP. The old IP was not removed, just the new IP was added as a secondary IP. This means every single web request chooses effectively randomly between the correct new IP address and old disconnected IP address. This is causing the outages.
Dan, if you could please:
* Keep the 162.159.134.42 A record for powerhousearts.org
* Delete the 64.98.135.124 A record for powerhousearts.org
And the problem should be fixed.
Thank you for your patience!

Ideal: Save the Date & Invite go out through zkipster to full prospect/invite list; Allow capture of inquiries through save date, and Registration through Invite email to our Event page (PHA website - processed by GiveLively), where they purchase Ticket or submit pledge form for Tables - What is your team structure in terms of owning steps in the process of cultivating event data Our core team will be small: me - main PHA user, PR lead, Production lead, David- Tech lead, + 5 users on event day - How quickly would you like the zkipster integration to be up and running?

Are there technical differences or cost differences (apart from the plan cost)? Re Salesforce pre-built integration, can you provide a document of what data is captured in zkipster and what data is included in the Salesforce integration. What's the total loaded cost, including any Salesforce connector costs? API Documentation requires a zkipster account. Can you provide either the document or a login invitation?

Good Morning Team,
Before our call with Zkipster this afternoon, I'm hoping the group can
weigh in with regard to the API Access component of the Zkipster account
proposal given that it comes with the $4300+ price tag.
Dan, were you able to get in to set up the whitelabel domain while we were
in trial?
In David's absence, I would be grateful for any tech weigh in here to

Hello Leon,
We reviewed this with our Service Desk Manager.
The request for Phoenix’s offboarding was sent in on 6/4/2024. This was completed the same day by Dan.
Our process for offboarding is to have a ticket submitted via an offboarding template.
Part of that offboarding is to remove licenses from the offboarded user however we do not delete accounts unless specifically noted.
In the case of Phoenix, this was completed.
Within Adobe there is no license assigned. Same for slack. ( See screenshots below)
The tickets you are reviewing have been automatically closed because they are being submitted from an automated system on your side.
I am not sure what triggers your system to determine if users have a license or not. Doing a physical check shows no license is assigned.
In regards to Ben, We do not manage the Momentus application. That was never in our application list.
As noted in past conversations, there have been some changes on what applications are supported internally vs what we have historically supported. We can revisit the application list again on our next call if you like.

Thanks, I received the approval and I understand the request. It takes 24-48 hours to process Mac quotes. Once I have more details, I will send over the tracking.
In this instance, and based on the size of these machines, I have asked procurement to deliver them to Powerhouse directly to Luther’s attention.
In all instances, we ship standard systems to our office for inventory purposes, for QC and setup purposes. Dan will work with Luther on the builds once received.
Please let me know if there are any issues or concerns here. I am waiting for procurement to confirm everything.
Warm regards, Erika

Please initiate this procurement (see screenshot, quantity: 2).
I have go-ahead from Steven Battaglia, but I'm new to the process, so feel free to educate me.
If procurement via TNS is documented somewhere, please send me the documentation.
David,
We have a desperate need of 2 new desktops. We have a budget of 5k and this is what we decided on for now. The color is the Powerhouse Red/Pink. Here is a screenshot of the remaining more critical components. Let me know if you have any questions

Subject: RE: FW: In need of 2 new iMacs

Thanks, I received the approval and I understand the request. It takes 24-48 hours to process Mac quotes. Once I have more details, I will send over the tracking.
In this instance, and based on the size of these machines, I have asked procurement to deliver them to Powerhouse directly to Luther’s attention.
In all instances, we ship standard systems to our office for inventory purposes, for QC and setup purposes. Dan will work with Luther on the builds once received.
Please let me know if there are any issues or concerns here. I am waiting for procurement to confirm everything.
Warm regards, Erika

Hey Erika!
Steve tells me he gave the go-ahead.
In case you didn't already know, Luther is hot to get them (apparently one of his boxes is on it's last breath right now) so when you have a delivery date, please let Luther know.
thanks
Sounds great, just a friendly reminder. Have a great weekend and thank you for your time on Friday. I am on it!

Please initiate this procurement (see screenshot, quantity: 2).
I have go-ahead from Steven Battaglia, but I'm new to the process, so feel free to educate me.
If procurement via TNS is documented somewhere, please send me the documentation.
David,
We have a desperate need of 2 new desktops. We have a budget of 5k and this is what we decided on for now. The color is the Powerhouse Red/Pink. Here is a screenshot of the remaining more critical components. Let me know if you have any questions

Hi David,
I submitted the request for the new Windows machine. You or Yarisbeth will need to complete a form for a system replacement. On the form you can add the request you can include any details with the build.
I provided the generic form just in case:
https://thetnsgroup.com/request/ - please click on the replacement option and include all details in the notes section.
Please let me know if you have any questions or we can discuss tomorrow. Thank you, Erika

Hi, David. The PC I use for the embroidery machine is nearly dead. It’s no longer charging properly, and yesterday I couldn’t get it to turn on… this morning it at least is updating and on.It hasn’t been maintained. It’s still trying to sign into dropbox, and I can’t remember when we made the switch to box, but before 2022…It’s severely under capacity for what I need it to do… it’s basically a microsoft touchscreen ipad—it can’t crunch the numbers it has to do do a lot of automated functions in the embroidery program. But it’s still useful for drawing things out manually. It would be great to have a dedicated computer. I’m really not sure what hard drive capacity I need, but I can reach out to the software developer to ask. Our software should be updated as well to really get the machine running... It would be great if it can run photoshop and illustrator.

David Goodman forwarded your note to me.
David's engaged as needed with Powerhouse, and I'm handling day-to-day.
I'd be interested to speak sometime in July to understand our usage.
In the meantime, if you send me current list of contacts, chances are good it needs updating.

Hi
David Goodman forwarded your note to me.
David's engaged as needed with Powerhouse, and I'm handling day-to-day.
I'd be interested to speak sometime in July to understand our usage.
In the meantime, if you send me current list of contacts, chances are good
it needs updating.
Cheers

Can you just check how the Meraki is priced, and if we should expect a big change? I think Steven believes there was a front-end payment and that the cost changes in year 3, but I don't have any information.
Hi David,
I sent in a request for a renewal budget from procurement earlier this week for all expenses. We do this for clients when building budgets prior to FY start date. This goes through procurement, and it can take up to 2 weeks to obtain it. I should have this to you and Steven by next week.
I will provide the cost for additional users and security solutions no later than Friday. Do you want me to reach out to Steven on the timing for renewals? I thought I could push it sooner – still working on it.

Dan when you're onsite:
As you know, Eugene at PoM requested that the cat6 going to the 4 elevator
cameras should have PoE DISABLED.
Please trace and label the relevant cat6 cables (4 of them?) in the IT
closets, and label the ports that should be PoE disabled.
Prior to changing anything, please advise whether PoE is currently on for
the elevator cameras that are working.
And, if possible, can Mitch or someone from the team can visually inspect
the 2-wire device on the working elevators to see if it shows a PoE
indicator light and if it is plugged in to a transformer.

Please remote in to Jenn Choi's computer preferably between 3-4 PM today, and install the BoA software which Jenn downloaded.
Jennifer Choi (copied) has downloaded a software package from Bank of America, which she requires for her work.
The installation may require privileges and tinkering.
There's a check scanner connected to her computer, which the software uses.

Subject: Powerhouse Network issues review

Hello David,
Please see our findings and timeline below concerning the recent network disruption that occurred.
Issue:
On Tuesday September 24th it was reported to Dan Lucas via email from Mitch about some concerning network issues.
Meraki portal showed switches on the 4th floor IDF closet with unstable connections.
Upon deeper review it was found that a reboot on certain switches had occurred on September 24th at 0125 from a firmware update.
Dan, working with the Meraki Support, was advised to rollback any firmware upgrades made.
Rollback of firmware was successful and helped stabilize network.
Further Investigation:
Due to past issues with firmware upgrades, further investigation was conducted by Rob Nieves to understand why the Firmware occurred, and why there were no alerts triggered.
Review of configuration confirmed Firmware Upgrade are not to be conducted unless scheduled.
Review of Logs shows there were no Firmware upgrades performed during outage window of September 24th.
Because of these inconsistencies, another case was opened with Merkai to understand how this could have happened.
Meraki support confirmed there was no official firmware upgrade on any of the switches, instead there was software update performed on their systems that would allow for "easier" stack configuration on switches.
As a result of this update, new settings were performed on select switches which caused them to reboot.
These changes were not reflected on any logs.
Current alerting procedures would send an email to support indicating devices being down for a period longer than 5 minutes.
Since this update only impacted a select few switches, and the reboot was brief, no alerts were triggered.
See images for configurations and alerts.
Figure1: Reboot of Switch
Figure2: Change log showing no Firmware updates performed reboot time
Firgure3: Meraki Support response
Remediation:
We are currently reviewing extra monitoring options within our RMM software on all Network equipment. ( Note: extra equipment may be needed to have a local probe installed within the network)
Opt in options for new settings have been disabled.
Added support@thetnsgroup.com to any Meraki update notices for quicker review.
Attempted to changed alerting period however 5 minutes is the lowest option.

TNS-Omega Integration Update: New Billing Portal, Live 7/1/24
David,
As part of our continued integration efforts between TNS and Omega Systems, we want to share an important change to our billing process, which will help enable a more efficient and effective billing experience for customers.
Beginning on Monday, July 1, legacy TNS customers should process payments to Omega Systems using our new billing portal, powered by ConnectBooster. This replaces our previous portal on bill.com.
The following payment methods are accepted via our new payment portal:
- ACH Pull – Omega initiates payments (preferred)
- ACH Push – Customer initiates payment
- Credit Card payments (subject to a processing fee)
Customers can access the new billing portal at any time here: https://email.omegasystemscorp.com/e3t/Ctc/2O+113/d2MMPQ04/VVqV098Hg-nPW51pPJ15l7V8pW3S9mTt5gPp56N179mqq3l5QzW7lCdLW6lZ3lTW8zxFlh23RFYDW9cThMd3MpQl-W5mQH3C47cTSrW3cfMXJ2tpMPnW7Hyc6K5pv7bZV8KxnL2F5FkzW6H1F9K6YGk35W5wxm7d1ddd6JW6RztdB9kBp75W30MDsH3vRH3BW8HcN5Q61Gd5nW6XfhWm1dVhwnW5zKBz21nh9xSW59gCwP632Pz1W6C8-501f-9SlW2z1-kL3VyP_lN5sXh4v_ffyDW10sX867tl-06W3Gc8G_1GtKW-W4W6zmL3D-ptRN3kdf9b7j59ZW4h37X77fLdd3VbCCPR7jhncHW84bpQh2PFpcdf6v8FQ604

Hello all
Attached are the zoom pro users and then Zoomus_users1 is the basic users:
The difference between each license basic has meeting limit for 40 minutes
Which looks like it is being applied to Sam's account and then the interns accounts.
Then the pro features are listed below
Zoom One Pro
All the benefits of Basic, plus:
Host up to 100 participants
No 40-minute limit
Team chat for collaboration, file sharing, and more3 editable
Whiteboards with 25MB of cloud storage
5GB of cloud recording storage (per license)
Automated captions
Access to game changing add-ons
The basic accounts were created for users who don't zoom that much from my understanding.
Thanks

I have been offsite this afternoon. I spoke to Dan and he will provide the requested information for the time length for each user.
For the licensing availability I will reach out to your rep.

Hi Erika!
Can you please give me an accounting of our Zoom licensing from the perspective of meeting length limits, and options to provide people with longer meeting times?
If that's out of scope, can you tell me the name and contact info for the Zoom account rep?
Someone ran into a 40-minute meeting limit with Zoom yesterday. I was surprised and asked Dan to take a look and tell me the license terms. It's true. At least some of our licenses are limited to 40 minute meetings, which is just short enough to be unacceptable.
I know Zoom changed terms back in July. Perhaps we have new or expiring accounts that are starting to run into the new limits?
Thank you!

Hello TNS Group
Can you tell me the default meeting length restriction for Powerhouse zoom users, and whether there's an option to upgrade this user to have longer meetings?
Hi David,
I'm limited to scheduling 40 min meetings (says I have a Zoom basic plan) when logged into my PHA account. Is that correct?

Hi Phonix - as discussed over the phone yesterday, the Genetec system already is configured to be accessed using the mobile app or any browser. In order to provide external access, I would like to speak with the IT team to ensure the right port forwarding rules are in place. Let me know when will be best to reach out. Thanks!

Hi Pamela,
Thank you for your outreach. If possible, going forward, a longer lead will be helpful in terms of confirming onsite resources on the weekend, which I know you are aware per your email below.
In this case, Dan is available on Sunday to be onsite. I sent a separate email to David and Steven for approval for the onsite. We will need that approval to go forward.
Is it possible for TNS to test with the vendor when we are onsite tomorrow? We want to make sure there are no issues as we will not have additional resources available on Sunday.
Also, Dan will work with Deesh when he is onsite tomorrow to go up to the mezzanine and do some testing.
Please let me know if you have any questions and/or if I missed anything.
Thank you, Erika

EXTERNAL EMAIL!!!
Hi Erika, Rob, Daniel,
I am reaching out because we have another large Fashion show with the same group / client as last September coming up.
The requirements for the internet service provided by the venue are the same and are in detail the following:
The internet connection must be provided through an ethernet cable positioned near the video control room.
The connection must be at least 30 Mbps in upload and download, guaranteed and dedicated to the streaming service.
Wi-Fi connections cannot be used.
To this network will be connected a router from which all the streaming equipment will be connected to.
The IP that will be assigned to the router must be able to make outgoing connections to the following ports / ip:
- TCP ports from 1195 to 1199 to IP 213.137.32.108
- UDP ports from 10001 to 10004 towards IP 213.137.32.108
- UDP ports from 10001 to 10004 towards IP 178.20.73.121
We are again planning on using the ports (marked by blue painters tape) on the recessed east wall of the Grand Hall mezzanine.
TNS, I wanted to check with you the following:
1. Are all these port settings still in place and if not could they please be restored?
2. Would it be possible for Daniel when he is at Powerhouse this coming Wednesday (Feb. 7) to connect with Deesh and go up to the mezzanine and do a streaming test?
3. Erika, I am very sorry this ask comes in again so late, but we are also hoping to be able to have a TNS technician onsite 8am-11am on February 11.
Let us know if this is all doable.
Thank you so much.
Pamela

Hi
Pamela,
Thank
you for your outreach. If possible, going forward, a longer lead will be helpful in terms of confirming onsite resources on the weekend, which I know you are aware per your email below.
In
this case, Dan is available on Sunday to be onsite. I sent a separate email to David and Steven for approval for the onsite. We will need that approval to go forward.
Is
it possible for TNS to test with the vendor when we are onsite tomorrow? We want to make sure there are no issues as we will not have additional resources available on Sunday.
Also,
Dan will work with Deesh when he is onsite tomorrow to go up to the mezzanine and do some testing.
Please
let me know if you have any questions and/or if I missed anything.

Hi
Erika, Rob, Daniel,
I
am reaching out because we have another large Fashion show with the same group / client as last September coming up.
The
requirements for the internet service provided by the venue are the same and are in detail the following:
The
internet connection must be provided through an ethernet cable positioned near the video control room.
The connection must be at least 30 Mbps in upload and download, guaranteed and dedicated to the streaming service.
Wi-Fi connections cannot be used.
To this network will be connected a router from which all the streaming equipment will be connected to.
The IP that will be assigned to the router must be able to make outgoing connections to the following ports / ip:
- TCP ports from 1195 to 1199 to IP 213.137.32.108
- UDP ports from 10001 to 10004 towards IP 213.137.32.108
- UDP ports from 10001 to 10004 towards IP 178.20.73.121
We
are again planning on using the ports (marked by blue painters tape) on the recessed east wall of the Grand Hall mezzanine.
TNS,
I wanted to check with you the following:
1.
Are all these port settings still in place and if not could they please be restored?
2.
Would it be possible for Daniel when he is at Powerhouse this coming Wednesday (Feb. 7) to connect with Deesh and go up to the mezzanine and do a streaming test?
3.
Erika, I am very sorry this ask comes in again so late, but we are also hoping to be able to have a TNS technician onsite 8am-11am on February 11.
Let
us know if this is all doable.
Thank
you so much.

We are again planning on using the ports (marked by blue painters tape) on the recessed east wall of the Grand Hall mezzanine.
TNS, I wanted to check with you the following:
1. Are all these port settings still in place and if not could they please be restored?
2. Would it be possible for Daniel when he is at Powerhouse this coming Wednesday (Feb. 7) to connect with Deesh and go up to the mezzanine and do a streaming test?
3. Erika, I am very sorry this ask comes in again so late, but we are also hoping to be able to have a TNS technician onsite 8am-11am on February 11.
Let us know if this is all doable.
Thank you so much.
Pamela

Hi Pamela,
Thank you for your outreach. If possible, going forward, a longer lead will be helpful in terms of confirming onsite resources on the weekend, which I know you are aware per your email below.
In this case, Dan is available on Sunday to be onsite. I sent a separate email to David and Steven for approval for the onsite. We will need that approval to go forward.
Is it possible for TNS to test with the vendor when we are onsite tomorrow? We want to make sure there are no issues as we will not have additional resources available on Sunday.
Also, Dan will work with Deesh when he is onsite tomorrow to go up to the mezzanine and do some testing.
Please let me know if you have any questions and/or if I missed anything.
Thank you, Erika

Subject: Fashion show Feb. 10 &11 same live streaming needs as September 10 &
 11 2023

Hi Erika, Rob, Daniel,
I am reaching out because we have another large Fashion show with the same
group / client as last September coming up.
The requirements for the internet service provided by the venue are the
same and are in detail the following:
*The internet connection must be provided through an ethernet cable
positioned near the video control room.The connection must be at least 30
Mbps in upload and download, guaranteed and dedicated to the streaming
service.Wi-Fi connections cannot be used.To this network will be connected
a router from which all the streaming equipment will be connected to.The IP
that will be assigned to the router must be able to make outgoing
connections to the following ports / ip:- TCP ports from 1195 to 1199 to IP
213.137.32.108- UDP ports from 10001 to 10004 towards IP 213.137.32.108-
UDP ports from 10001 to 10004 towards IP 178.20.73.121 *
We are again planning on using the ports (marked by blue painters tape) on
the recessed east wall of the Grand Hall mezzanine.
TNS, I wanted to check with you the following:
1. Are all these port settings still in place and if not could they please
be restored?
2. Would it be possible for Daniel when he is at Powerhouse this coming
Wednesday (Feb. 7) to connect with Deesh and go up to the mezzanine and do
a streaming test?
3. Erika, I am very sorry this ask comes in again so late, but we are also

As we discussed a few months ago, MGC is moving in to Powerhouse over the next few weeks. It's a small organization, with 2 computers and 4 printers, and from a technology perspective this should be handled like a merger.
Can you please assist? This is my checklist; add/correct/comment as needed:
1. Tee up procurement approvals for 2 Macbook Pro 14" computers, standard Powerhouse spec. (I sent it separately to Erika)
* I submitted a request for the 2 MacBooks. I will need you to complete 2 forms but we are amid changing this process – you will receive a notification this week. I will reach out to you as soon as I know the process is in place.
1. Daniel and I walked through the 5th floor space about a month ago to confirm WiFi is operational, please confirm. Dan will confirm this and will circle back to you.
2. Initiate port of an existing MGC phone number from VZ over to Zoom (if Omega can't do this, let me know and dk will handle) Daniel will reach out to you directly and Most of it will be on Zoom and we will need the phone numbers to Zoom so we can port it over. Please provide Dan the phone umbers
3. Assess MGC telecom needs: a handset for existing MGC number? zoom auto attendant? Dan will handle and will reach out to you next Wednesday onsite – he just needs to know what extension you want us to assign it to it and the Mac address on the 5th floor
4. Recommend how to handle manhattangraphicscenter.org domain. MGC needs to retain their domain for now, including website and email addresses for about a half dozen people. They will be on the powerhousearts HR system and need access to the usual PHA systems like zoom, box, asana, etc. Dan will talk to you directly. We have to take in their domain – are we allowing them into the Google Admin Console or just creating PH accounts?
Dan will focus on these items next Wednesday when he is onsite.
Thank you for the update on this. Many thanks, Erika

Hi All,
We're trying to consolidate our computer usage so that laptops aren't
shared with multiple members in our department. There is a laptop here that
Jeff told me to reach out to see if we can get it reset; there are
currently just a few former employees that have accounts on it that we
can't get into. I'd also like to transfer my programs from my current
computer if possible and set up an account on the "new" laptop. Is this
something we can do today or this week?
Thank you,
Evan

Hi David,
We reviewed the setup instructions and part of the process appears to be allowing Arternal to access all Google services. Can you provide more detail on how the email integration feature will be used, as well as any other Arternal features you may be interested
in utilizing?

Request
Configure Arternal with Third-Part App access on Powerhouse Google Workspace.
These are the directions from Arternal:
https://intercom.help/arternal/en/articles/5812133-linking-google-email-accounts
This is time sensitive, due by Tue Nov 14 -- earlier would be terrific. If that's not possible, please alert me. Thank you!
Background
Powerhouse has signed up with Arternal, a SaaS provider for art sales. To support integrated email (and some other capabilities?) Arternal requested access rights.
Additional Points of Contact
Powerhouse customer and point-of-contact for Arternal is: Megan Skidmore ( megan@powerhousearts.org )
Arternal point-of-contact (non-technical): Georgieanna Richer ( georgeianna@arternal.com )
Notes
Follow your standard protocol for these kinds of admin changes to Google Workspace, as far as any logging or permissions.
When you configure, please check if Arternal is requiring any "sensitive" or "restricted" Google API Oauth scopes, and whether access can be restricted to named Powerhouse accounts.
Thank you

I will work on getting my contacts set up in CSV to send to you in the next day.

Quickest solution: Call TNS so they can log on to the administrative console, and you can work through the specific settings to reach a solution.
ARTERNAL is set up with managed access to Powerhouse employee email currently.

Georgianna,
We adjusted Arternal app permissions in Google from Limited to Trusted (which allows all services), and after that Megan was able to link the account.
Also when checking the OAuth logs, we see that Arternal was granted access to the " https://mail.google.com/ " scope
What error are you getting that shows Arternal is blocked from Gmail?

Hi Megan and David,
So it looks like ARTERNAL still does not have access to gmail, David is there anything else you need from us? You should be able to allow Megan's account access through the admin panel, if you have any questions please let me know.

David,
Arternal has been added to the the apps list under App Access Control
2. The OAuth scope is currently not listed. App access for google services is set to Limited for now but can be changed if necessary.
3. Access is available to users in the powerhouse.org domain, although we can change this to specific OUs if you would like to to restrict it further.
Let me know if you need more information.

Hi David,
We reviewed the setup instructions and part of the process appears to be allowing Arternal to access all Google services. Can you provide more detail on how the email integration feature will be used, as well as any other Arternal features you may be interested
in utilizing?

Request
Configure Arternal with Third-Part App access on Powerhouse Google Workspace.
These are the directions from Arternal:
https://intercom.help/arternal/en/articles/5812133-linking-google-email-accounts
This is time sensitive, due by Tue Nov 14 -- earlier would be terrific. If that's not possible, please alert me. Thank you!
Background
Powerhouse has signed up with Arternal, a SaaS provider for art sales. To support integrated email (and some other capabilities?) Arternal requested access rights.
Additional Points of Contact
Powerhouse customer and point-of-contact for Arternal is: Megan Skidmore ( megan@powerhousearts.org )
Arternal point-of-contact (non-technical): Georgieanna Richer ( georgeianna@arternal.com )
Notes
Follow your standard protocol for these kinds of admin changes to Google Workspace, as far as any logging or permissions.
When you configure, please check if Arternal is requiring any "sensitive" or "restricted" Google API Oauth scopes, and whether access can be restricted to named Powerhouse accounts.
Thank you

It would be helpful, however, to understand who might be the appropriate

Jasmine:
Powerhouse is doing its first big mailing today.
It's critical for someone with zkipster expertise to take a look at what's
going out, how the system is configured, to support Megan in being
successful.
The tech team just completed "white label" changes a few minutes ago. I
was asked to review the outgoing email for deliverability hygiene a few

the online app is just autocad's online viewer. it is limited. you can sign
on for free.
It took several minutes to open up the file, then I took a screenshot to
send you.

So that App that you used opens it as a PDF?
Or can it also open it as a view only dwg?
I am using eDrawings because that actually allows me to open it as a dwg,
just not manipulate it.

Hi Pamela:
I'll let TNS work on this.
In the meantime, I'll test if the file looks healthy by trying to open it
on the autocad site: https://viewer.autodesk.com/

Hi David and TNS support team,
I am having trouble opening the dwg file attached to the email forwarded
here with my eDrawings reader App.
Can you take a look at it and guide me toward what is wrong here?
I have successfully opened other dfx and dwg files from the same sender.
But for some reason this one opens just in squiggles for me. In fact I am
also attaching here a screenshot of what I am seeing when I am opening the
file.
As far as things, I have already tried on my end these are:
Close everything and restart computer
Update google chrome browser and restart
This drawing happens to be important as it is the floor plan with chairs
for our April fundraising dinner.
Thank you so much.
Pam

Hi David,
No, TNS does not handle Zoom licensing – we were told that it would be handled internally. It is my understanding that you must reach out to Powerhouse’s Zoom account manager:
Jalen Thibodeaux
jalen.thibodeaux@zoom.us - for the licenses and they will provide a quote for approval. Ben/Paul were handling this in the past.
When we do onboardings, the license is available when we do the new hire setup.
This is one of those items where there is a process in place outside of TNS, in general.
I added this item and others on our agenda for our monthly meeting next week. We want to review and discuss these types of items so we can come to an agreement whether Powerhouse wants TNS to handle it.
I hope that helps. Thank you, Erika

Hi Erika!
Can you please give me an accounting of our Zoom licensing from the perspective of meeting length limits, and options to provide people with longer meeting times?
If that's out of scope, can you tell me the name and contact info for the Zoom account rep?
Someone ran into a 40-minute meeting limit with Zoom yesterday. I was surprised and asked Dan to take a look and tell me the license terms. It's true. At least some of our licenses are limited to 40 minute meetings, which is just short enough to be unacceptable.
I know Zoom changed terms back in July. Perhaps we have new or expiring accounts that are starting to run into the new limits?
Thank you!

Trend Watch: Benefits of a Virtual CISO
The presence of a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is a must-have to ensure continued resilience against growing threats as well as proper alignment of IT priorities with business needs and regulatory requirements. But for many companies, hiring a full-time CISO is not feasible and can be hindered by limited finances or expertise.
Enter the virtual CISO (vCISO) – someone who offers the expertise and guidance of a seasoned security professional, delivered by a trusted IT partner who acts as an extension of your internal executive team.
Check out these 7 benefits of a virtual CISO (https://email.omegasystemscorp.com/e3t/Ctc/2O+113/d2MMPQ04/VVX19l3PnvM8W7LFkpk2fbvDmW4nNzqf5fMg9KN3Bm-8K3prCCW95jsWP6lZ3lLW4QC1j55cf2Q9W175QF-8Vt35KW2sszRC1kCc78W5pJ3cd5Mwy3bW5pVjC62pwmFHW16_QnD4RX0XTN8qx7XzNy87mVBWBvK2yQZR0W2Ksn6V2wWv14W8J7n-C7MTDXlW5j-jt48V9GflW8JfswD83xW3_N6djxKvwTMwLW3zBQPQ34-v6DW8BPHY26XWlkmW5bmMFv1K_cmrW40xrcF48H3k9W6Y53cj1j6jr9W2lPPb73xXLJFW6ncZC38XBxhXW3QZlDg6SdX1nVYQXpN1F6Q5WW84bQlC2fW6lLW18N0sw6VfKF4W8dD-_C3pMhnjW7ypmR2801vTlW5nnP__1y6CJ7W4xXcgs2ND2stW4qdYq42nvgkfW3YWJMX89xVWJf6HbJsd04 ) .

Fantastic!
Looks fairly straightforward. We are going to install a wireless AP on the roof. It should have good coverage where needed.
This device will only have internet access and not access to the lan.
We have the work scheduled for Monday or Tuesday(based on weather).

Yes - I realize I didn’t answer Eric’s question: internet access would probably be fine.
Hi David and Robert,
Thank you both for continuing this conversation regarding the internet access the engineering department needs up on the boiler house roof. Yes a good starting point would be to do a walk thru with the engineering department in early January to discuss the requirements needed. Additionally, I will contact my BMS vendor to confirm wifi for internet access or if we need to connect to the LAN in the building, I believe it would be wife for internet access though.
Happy Holidays,
Mitch
Eric,
That's great to hear! I'm copying our colleagues from TNS, and Mitch Roth, Director of Facilities at Powerhouse. My suggestion is that you all find a time to meet at the building in early Jan to walk this through. I'll project manage it remotely, to the degree that's necessary. Happy Holidays and safe New Years!
David
Hi David,
Yeah that should be fairly straightforward. We would have to install an AP though as the equipment thats currently up there doesn’t do typical wifi. If it’s just to cover the accessible roof area we could probably attach that AP right to the mast we installed.
Would the guys need wifi for internet access or would they need to connect to your LAN in the building?
Just let me know when you guys need it setup by.
Thank you,
Eric Veksler
347.464.9473
Eric,
I hope you're doing well. We're trying to figure out how to get WiFi on the roof so that the facilities team can access the web while doing maintenance on the equipment up there. Is there any way to use your existing equipment on the roof to do that, rather than having to drill a cable path through the core? Thx!

Subject: Re: I Pad library - relatively urgent need for capturing device for
 speaker series

Hi folks,
Deesh connected with Xavier and I separately about this to gauge our
interest in local vs cloud storage. Perhaps we should have a meeting (gasp)
about all this so everyone can be on the same page? Designing a content
management system specific to AV needs is no small thing.
FWIW:
- I see local storage of raw footage and Cloud based storage for final
files being a good solution.
- I don't think social media should be a determining factor for how we
store files, as the files we post there are so small and end up going to
our computers before we do so anyway.
- Similarly, captioning is handled differently by different platforms
and we wouldn't want to caption anything raw or burn anything in anyway...
it's easy enough to take a final cut of a video file and send it out for an
.srt file.
All that said, I think we should meet to talk about how any approach we
come up with might be scaled, considering all the different use cases for
recording, editing, and distributing, so we can future-proof it while being
mindful about nimbleness, flexibility, cost, etc.
David, can you set up a time for folks to meet that works with your
schedule and take the lead on an agenda, etc. so you get the answers you
need?
Thanks,
Sam

Hi David,
here are some of my thoughts:below your questions in caps. Getting this out
ahead of slack channel because of my (at least perceived) backlog of things
to do.
- For iPhones, certainly, cloud storage is fully integrated and very
convenient. Do we use any other kinds of cameras?
- NOT AT THIS POINT
- iCloud may also be integrated with video editing, captioning, etc
tools you use? True?
- I AM HOPING MARKETING WILL TAKE THE LEAD ON EDITING
- iCloud may be well integrated with a workflow that involves posting
things to social media. Do we use any tools for social media management?
- I AM HOPING MARKETING WILL TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS AS WELL
- If the data volume gets very high, it can get slow and expensive to
move and keep data in the cloud, and local storage can make more sense; the
Genetec surveillance cameras, for instance, have a few racks of disk
storage in the Powerhouse IT room.
- SO FAR, I HAD BEEN USED TO THE OPPOSITE ROUTINE. THE PERSON WHO EDITED
MOVED BOTH RAW FOOTAGE AND THE EDITED VERSION ONTO THE CLOUD FOR MORE
PERSONS TO ACCESS IT AND TO MAKE ROOM ON THE LOCAL STORAGE OF THE DEVICE.
BUT I DEFINITELY KNOW LESS THAN YOU (DAVID) ABOUT THESE THINGS.
- Do we have a desire/need for some level of on-site studio space, with
lighting, fixed cam, possibly a teleprompter?
- NO. WE WANT TO HAVE THE SET UP BE MOBILE AND USABLE IN ALL OF OUR
SPACES. IN OUR CONCEPT SO FAR, WE ALSO CONSIDERED THE SYSTEM TO BE MOBILE
ENOUGH FOR CEP TO TAKE IT OUR OUT ON THE STREET TO CONDUCT FIELD INTERVIEWS
ETC.
- A hybrid solution might be to keep network attached storage on premise
(fast), and migrate it to "long term" cloud storage in the background
(slow). We (Daniel from TNS and I) are experimenting with local network
storage connecting to Box, to help Print Shop deal with large files more
easily.
- DEFERRING TO YOU AND TNS FOR BEST SOLUTION
- At the same time we're thinking about video storage, we should be
thinking about a system we can all use for naming and organizing and/or
adding metadata (like location, people names) to video. This is really
valuable. And it needs to be something easy enough that people will
actually use it consistently.
- SOMETHING LIKE: "DEPARTMENT / DATE AND YEAR / NAME OF EVENT" FOR
EXAMPLE?
All my best,
Pam

If necessary, I can ask our procurement team to make an exception. Is this something that Powerhouse can purchase directly?

Hi Steven and David,
we just had a meeting with Jenn and Jackie from CEP.
We are looking for a high quality device to film the April 9 edition of the speaker series.
You recently spoke about an IPad library.
In fact an Iphone 15 is said to have a remarkably better camera than any latest Ipad.
Would you consider to potentially make an I phone 15 part of this device library?
And how soon would it be possible to have any of these library devices in house?
Longer term, we are also curious what the plan for any cloud storage of the raw materials will be. Will that be solved via box?

Hi David,
Forgive me for the delay as I am at an offsite meeting for work.
For my clarity, are you asking TNS to procure an iPhone for Powerhouse. We do not procure phones, just devices such as iPads, Macs, etc.
If necessary, I can ask our procurement team to make an exception. Is this something that Powerhouse can purchase directly?
Please advise. Thank you, Erika

Noted on the time crunch - I support the purchase. David can assist with turning that into an action item.
He and I haven't had a chance to connect in the last few days about cloud storage for raw material, but I know he's thinking about it. Will let him respond.

Hi Steven and David,
we just had a meeting with Jenn and Jackie from CEP.
We are looking for a high quality device to film the April 9 edition of the speaker series.
You recently spoke about an IPad library.
In fact an Iphone 15 is said to have a remarkably better camera than any latest Ipad.
Would you consider to potentially make an I phone 15 part of this device library?
And how soon would it be possible to have any of these library devices in house?
Longer term, we are also curious what the plan for any cloud storage of the raw materials will be. Will that be solved via box?
Thank you so much and apologies if I am missing bits of info because of my recent absence.
All my best,

Hi Pamela!
library?
*Yes. I initiated the procurement and will follow up regarding timing. *
solved via box?
That's an excellent question.
We have a few approaches. I'd like to do a little back-of-the-envelope
brainstorming with you all. These are the kinds of considerations I'm
thinking of:
- For iPhones, certainly, cloud storage is fully integrated and very
convenient. Do we use any other kinds of cameras?
- iCloud may also be integrated with video editing, captioning, etc
tools you use? True?
- iCloud may be well integrated with a workflow that involves posting
things to social media. Do we use any tools for social media management?
- If the data volume gets very high, it can get slow and expensive to
move and keep data in the cloud, and local storage can make more sense; the
Genetec surveillance cameras, for instance, have a few racks of disk
storage in the Powerhouse IT room.
- Do we have a desire/need for some level of on-site studio space, with
lighting, fixed cam, possibly a teleprompter?
- A hybrid solution might be to keep network attached storage on premise
(fast), and migrate it to "long term" cloud storage in the background
(slow). We (Daniel from TNS and I) are experimenting with local network
storage connecting to Box, to help Print Shop deal with large files more
easily.
- At the same time we're thinking about video storage, we should be
thinking about a system we can all use for naming and organizing and/or
adding metadata (like location, people names) to video. This is really
valuable. And it needs to be something easy enough that people will
actually use it consistently.
Let's pick up this discussion on slack. I'll invite y'all into a channel.
Cheers,
/dk

Dear Accounts:
Attached, please find your invoice referenced above. Please let us know if you have any questions.
Please make note
of the amount due for this invoice: $16,590.22.
If TNS already has your payment information on file, you may reply to this email to authorize payment.
TNS encourages clients to consider using Automated Clearing House (ACH) to submit payments rather than company checks. The authorized billing contact for your organization can set up ACH to allow TNS to automatically process payment for open invoices and keep your account current. For more information on authorizing TNS to process ACH payments, please contact the TNS Finance Department.
If you would prefer to submit payments to TNS by ACH manually, please contact your Account Manager or the TNS Finance Department for assistance.
Thank you for choosing The TNS Group for your technology needs.

Subject: RE: Is Jamf still being used?

Jamf has been retired for some time so we could remove that SAML that portal is no longer active

Subject: Is Jamf still being used?
EXTERNAL EMAIL!!!
It looks like we switched from Jamf to Addigy and no longer use Jamf. Can you confirm that Jamf is *not* being used, and I could remove the SAML entries?
SAML credentials were set up using Google Workspace as an IdP for Jamf. It would be good security hygiene to get rid of the SAML entries if we're not using the app. Or, if we are, the credentials are set to expire and will need renewal.
(I'm leaving David G out of this, because I know he has a busy few weeks)
Thank you

Hi Erika!
For our standing meeting, can you put on the agenda "establish an iPad library"
From the recent purchase and request pending, I think we're looking at a situation where IT manages a "library" of about 5 iPads, that are bookable resources.
Thank you

Hi David,
Outside of the image I provided yesterday from Powerhouse. That is all we show under our purview.
Per procurement:
Hey Erika. There are no monthly charges on the powerhousearts.org account. I also checked the Gemini Arts google and there is no monthly $12 charge for domains there. Not sure where that is coming from but it’s not the 2 that we have access to. He may need to get in touch with Google to track that down.
I did find this correspondence below from 2020 as this came up then. It looks it is a renewal for Enom. I hope this helps! Erika

Subject: Re: PHA Front desk phone not working

Colleagues
I'd like to chime in on this with some ideas that may help.
The topic deserves more discussion, but for now I'll highlight the most
relevant points from a tech support perspective. Please help me by
understanding these points, suggesting improvements (always), and becoming
ambassadors to model and share these concepts with the rest of the team.
All of you are 100% right that we should identify and fix important issues
quickly.
Sometimes it's hard to know which issues deserve to be escalated. Here are
some guidelines:
-
High Priority:
-
disrupts programs or events
-
affects our work with artists, public, donors, partners
-
keeps key staff (president, board, team leads) from performing their
duties, which in turn can impact their teams
-
Normal Priority:
-
affects a small number of individuals
-
creates delays or inefficiencies in workflows
-
causes inconvenience or frustration but can be worked around
The front desk phone being out of service is a high priority issue. You
handle calls from the public, visitors, event attendees, and team leads.
How to report a tech issue: There are a few ways:
-
Send an email to helpdesk@powerhousearts.org
-
This forwards to Omega Systems (formerly known as TNS)
-
If the issue is high priority, start your email subject with “HIGH
PRIORITY”
-
I wrote (but have not tested) a slack workflow which is even better;
please try it out:
-
Open slack
-
On the left hand sidebar, select the ellipsis symbol (...) labeled
More
-
Select Automations from the menu
-
Hopefully, you will see this automation
-
-
Select it.
-
The first time you use it, you will be prompted to give it permission
to use your Gmail account (to send the help desk ticket). Go ahead and do
that.
-
When you’re in a slack message window, at the very start of your
message, before you type anything else, type /help and you should be
prompted to run the automation.
-
(If the above does not work, contact: wait for it...
helpdesk@powerhousearts.org. Say you need help installing the
helpdesk automation in slack. Dan knows about it.)
-
The automation asks you to name the ticket, describe it, and indicate
if it is High Priority and if it has a due date. This creates a
well-structured helpdesk request that gets mailed to Omega Systems. You
will receive a ticket receipt in your email.
Cheers,
/dk

Subject: Re: PHA Front desk phone not working

Hi All,
I’m glad the phone issue has finally been resolved. This was an important
matter that I had communicated through Slack and included in our daily
reports multiple times over the past few days since Community Day. In
which, in hindsight, there seems to have been other clues prior to our
event that there was an issue that went unnoticed or proactively looked
into. However, it seems that my previous communications on this issue were
not acknowledged or addressed until my team member, Veena, sent an email,
which resulted in a swift resolution.
I am all for suggesting solutions, being a team player, and understanding
that things may occasionally fall through the cracks. However, I feel that
communications such as the Daily Reports, especially when they raise other
operational concerns—such as more falling debris in the lobby during
Community Day (one of which was a screw) and an increase in staff
forgetting their ID cards leading to moments when there are no temporary
cards to give out—should be read and responded to in a timely manner.
Without this improvement, I will have no reason to believe contributing to
solutions would be taken any more seriously.

Good morning,
Per Pamela’s email below, she is asking for a TNS tech onsite on Monday - have a TNS technician onsite 8am-11am on Sunday, February 11.
This will be billable outside of the contract. I will need your approval to move forward.
Please advise. Thank you, Erika

Hi Erika, Rob, Daniel,
I am reaching out because we have another large Fashion show with the same group / client as last September coming up.
The requirements for the internet service provided by the venue are the same and are in detail the following:
The internet connection must be provided through an ethernet cable positioned near the video control room.
The connection must be at least 30 Mbps in upload and download, guaranteed and dedicated to the streaming service.
Wi-Fi connections cannot be used.
To this network will be connected a router from which all the streaming equipment will be connected to.
The IP that will be assigned to the router must be able to make outgoing connections to the following ports / ip:
- TCP ports from 1195 to 1199 to IP 213.137.32.108
- UDP ports from 10001 to 10004 towards IP 213.137.32.108
- UDP ports from 10001 to 10004 towards IP 178.20.73.121
We are again planning on using the ports (marked by blue painters tape) on the recessed east wall of the Grand Hall mezzanine.
TNS, I wanted to check with you the following:
1. Are all these port settings still in place and if not could they please be restored?
2. Would it be possible for Daniel when he is at Powerhouse this coming Wednesday (Feb. 7) to connect with Deesh and go up to the mezzanine and do a streaming test?
3. Erika, I am very sorry this ask comes in again so late, but we are also hoping to be able to have a TNS technician onsite 8am-11am on February 11.
Let us know if this is all doable.
Thank you so much.
Pamela

The Team Leads meetings are Mar 6, 20, Apr 3, 17 from 9:30 to 10:45AM.
Would it work to show your face for 5 minutes at one of those times?
Otherwise, I can look at tacking 15 minutes on the end of our planned April 10 Quarterly onsite.
Let me know what works best.

Daniel! I wasn't sure exactly where you said you left it regarding Jen's software.
Is it accurate if I say to Jen:
"Jen
I understand from Dan that he remotely loaded the BoA software. As soon as you or me want to, we can walk through testing the check scanner. I could do that for you Tue, or Dan could on Wed, or you could give it a go yourself.
Can you confirm this is your understanding, and whether that works for you?"

Subject: Jen Choi's BoA software

Daniel! I wasn't sure exactly where you said you left it regarding Jen's
software.
Is it accurate if I say to Jen:
"Jen
I understand from Dan that he remotely loaded the BoA software. As soon as
you or me want to, we can walk through testing the check scanner. I could
do that for you Tue, or Dan could on Wed, or you could give it a go
yourself.
Can you confirm this is your understanding, and whether that works for you?"

David,
Thank you for the information. PHA does not have any internal servers.
We can discuss further on the call. We do not support the BMS system but are happy to work with them if there are any network related issues.

Subject: Re: meeting with kode labs
EXTERNAL EMAIL!!!
Thanks -
I can make myself available for this most times today/wed/thu excepting a few important meetings.
The gist of it is that kode labs wants to install a (widely used 3rd party) listener on a (existing?) server inside PHA alongside the building management system, which can ingest building management messages emitted by (mostly) HVAC gear using an industry standard messaging protocol. That listener will transport the same data to kode labs (a cloudflare agent) so they can perform magical analytics and recommendations to the facilities team regarding efficient energy management.
There's exec support to move forward, because the promised benefit is high value.
I have more detailed notes and can fill you in.
Hi David,
Happy New Year!!! Looking forward to working together more in the new year.
Rob is more than happy to jump on a call, but he would like more information if you have it available. Please let me know the dates/times that work best, and I will review with Rob and get back to you if that works.
I copied Rob here as well so you can provide more details if available.
Thank you, Erika

Erika:
We need to assess a 3rd-party vendor's request to poke a hole in the firewall for a data collector which would connected to the building management system.
I want to have a 1-hour phone meeeting including the vendor and Robert, preferably sometime this week. The goal is to nail down the details sufficiently to make the necessary adjustments and move forward.
Thank you, and happy new year!

David,
Thank you for the information. PHA does not have any internal servers.
We can discuss further on the call. We do not support the BMS system but are happy to work with them if there are any network related issues.

Thanks -
I can make myself available for this most times today/wed/thu excepting a few important meetings.
The gist of it is that kode labs wants to install a (widely used 3rd party) listener on a (existing?) server inside PHA alongside the building management system, which can ingest building management messages emitted by (mostly) HVAC gear
using an industry standard messaging protocol. That listener will transport the same data to kode labs (a cloudflare agent) so they can perform magical analytics and recommendations to the facilities team regarding efficient energy management.
There's exec support to move forward, because the promised benefit is high value.
I have more detailed notes and can fill you in.

My apologies for the delay in sending my notes/action items. Dan and Rob were able to review the notes as well.
If we are all in agreement of the action items, I will create tickets internally for the TNS deliverables.

Steven and David,
Thank you again for the time last week – it was a great meeting!
My apologies for the delay in sending my notes/action items. Dan and Rob were able to review the notes as well.
If we are all in agreement of the action items, I will create tickets internally for the TNS deliverables.
I welcome your feedback and please let me know if you have any questions.
Warm regards, Erika

EDR vs. MDR: What’s the Difference?
EDR and MDR are two powerful threat detection and response tools that can significantly enhance your organization's cybersecurity posture. And while often used interchangeably, they serve different purposes for your security protection.
Learn more about EDR and MDR (https://email.omegasystemscorp.com/e3t/Ctc/2O+113/d2MMPQ04/MWJWcQXtscZW6ZXyBS40Q9rqW7gFL9V5gRfbXN9k7MbP3prCCW95jsWP6lZ3lHVthXRV3ZZPtSW9ljtCp5QjTGcW6-DJ2-5nrP6vVHgzDP3yQgk-W2mfpCS9fdmL8W77vpHn4xdntLVFW6zL3D3kF2W53ssRm20L0dmV89ckH3533DxW97f0y84zjpRPW457M6C749Cs1W4LbpQQ3rWJ0KW5HFD6P56TQZ5W60Ldw36Ym3DhW5w1rCs3zW-9RW6rGbbq4c7nkGW4nsSyK3L5sb5W12HVmZ4vVw38VzWHm-3rx_3PW3JLrL726ky8gW3TXWB530nplqW2Wv1VK2QDBdHN3bcYP-8fqBmW1B9w9J4PhLNKW46f5Rs4Zyrh3Vz5FwS22G4z7W3P9BK33YJKhHVSFF9K22KzFjW986Ww15h78_qW5P3HYq4-2Yb-f8vTJH404 ) , including:

Frequently Asked Questions
What if I will not be available to receive my shipment?
Most of our shipments contain valuable items, so our carriers are required to obtain a signature upon delivery. However, orders delivered by Postal Service do not require a signature. If you are unable to sign for delivery, the carrier will leave a calling card. You can then contact the carrier directly to schedule a new delivery appointment or alternatively amend your delivery address.
For more information about Apple's delivery options, visit online Help.
How do I track my shipment?
Visit online Order Status to view the most up-to-date status of your order. If you ordered multiple items, you may receive separate shipments with no additional shipping charges. For more information about shipping or returns, please visit online Help.
You can also contact your Business Team with any questions.

You may see from my original email that the purpose of getting on to Google
iDp is to:
map whatever SAML attributes in Google Workspace are relevant to the Box
user experience: name and email, of course, but also department, title,
report-to, phone if that's available.
As well as SCIM provisioning / deprovisioning and default folders based on
OU.
Can you assist me with any of that?

Hello Bob & Team:
The reason I thought we're using Microsoft ADFS and not Google idP is because of this:

Benjamin Molenaar, Feb 25, 2024, 5:23 PM EST
Hi David,
Thanks for supplying the metadata file. I can see that the Connection ID contained in this file matches the connection that is already applied to your enterprise. If you're happy to use this existing connection, you can enable SSO Test Mode under Admin Console > Enterprise Settings > User Settings > Configure SSO. Once this is enabled users will have the option to sign in via SSO or via Box credentials.
Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
Thanks,
Ben

Hi,
Thanks for contacting Box Support. My name is Ben and I understand you're looking to switch IdP from ADFS to Google. I can definitely assist.
Could you please provide the XML metadata file from the IdP? This will allow us to configure the connection on our side.
To answer your question, this will not affect user's ability to log in to O365.
Thanks,

Hello -
I'm seeking to move our idp from the current ADFS over to Google Workspace. We have users of both Google Workspace and Office 365. If there are implications for our users please tell me. Will the change break the user experience for people who use MS Word?
I'd like to map whatever SAML attributes in Google Workspace are relevant to the Box user experience: name and email, of course, but also department, title, report-to, phone if that's available.

I can definitely assist. Could you please provide the XML metadata file from the IdP? This will allow us to configure the connection on our side.

Technical Support Engineer I Community and Knowledge Base: https://support.box.com David Koosis Feb 15, 2024, 4:57 PM EST Hello - I'm seeking to move our idp from the current ADFS over to Google Workspace. We have users of both Google Workspace and Office 365. If there are implications for our users please tell me. Will the change break the user experience for people who use MS Word? I'd like to map whatever SAML attributes in Google Workspace are relevant to the Box user experience: name and email, of course, but also department, title, report-to, phone if that's available. /dk Attachment(s) noun-dog-202721-FFFFFF.png

Hi Leon,
Just a quick follow-up. We will need the approval by November 20th. If we do not get signature by that date, your licensing will go month-to-month with a 20% increase on each license. You can always go from month-to-month to annual. This is all mandated by Microsoft, not Omega.
Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you, Erika

Erika,
I discussed with David, and we want to maintain our monthly commitments. We’re also looking to clean up our current list of users to ensure we’re licensing only those actively using the MS Office suite. I hope Daniel can provide us with a list of user’s activity, who have been using the suite actively and those who have not.

Hi Leon,
Per our call, Powerhouse Arts is up for NCE Licensing for Microsoft Licensing. Attached please find the following:
1. The current list of Office Licensing for Powerhouse for Business Standard
2. The NCE Licensing renewal for Powerhouse
* The quote shows the pricing for NCE Annual Licensing for 57 licenses
i. Note if a user leaves, we can reassign an annual license to a new hire if available
* If you want to go Month-to-Month, you will incur a 20% increase per license from Microsoft
Please let me know if you have any questions. Will you be speaking to Steve about this for review/approval purposes?
If we do not move forward, the licensing will month-to-month and costs will increase. You can always go from month-to-month for Annual Licensing, but you cannot go from Annual to Month-to-month.
Please let me know if you have questions and let me know how I ca help
Many thanks, Erika

Thank you for your email. I had sent over the list of licensing with the users attached. If you want to do any clean up with those licenses, now is the time to do so. I am glad you are doing your due diligence. You can send any changes directly to support.
For additional information, such as activity, you can send that to support as well support@thetnsgroup.com and you can copy me, so we have a ticket for Dan/our team to work from.
Thank you, Erika

Erika,
I discussed with David, and we want to maintain our monthly commitments. We’re also looking to clean up our current list of users to ensure we’re licensing only those actively using the MS Office suite. I hope Daniel can provide us with a list of user’s activity, who have been using the suite actively and those who have not.
Best,

Can you just check how the Meraki is priced, and if we should expect a big change? I think Steven believes there was a front-end payment and that the cost changes in year 3, but I don't have any information.
Hi David,
I sent in a request for a renewal budget from procurement earlier this week for all expenses. We do this for clients when building budgets prior to FY start date. This goes through procurement, and it can take up to 2 weeks to obtain it. I should have this to you and Steven by next week.
I will provide the cost for additional users and security solutions no later than Friday. Do you want me to reach out to Steven on the timing for renewals? I thought I could push it sooner – still working on it.
Let me know what is best! Thank you, Erika

Hi David,
With Rob and I coming back from our company retreat today, schedules are tight. Rob is available from 12-1230 today, as am me. I am available at our regular time or noon. I wanted to see if you wanted me to move it to 12 pm so Rob can join.
Let me know what is best for you and look forward to catching up! Erika

Hi David,
Thanks again for setting up the network at AW. I was there over the weekend and it worked like a charm.
We brought some pc's and some printers: it may take a few weeks until we see where they will land: I believe the pc's are wi-fi compatible. I'll have to figure out at least my own this week as I have an audit firm coming to visit Friday to work on our fiscal 2023 report.

Hi Steven,
I am moving Powerhouse to the Annual Subscription as requested below. I must provide the report on this NO Later than Friday so we can process the information with Microsoft.
We can revisit at any time, but if you go with the annual licensing, Powerhouse will need to pay the licensing for 1 year. In doing so there will not be a price increase. If you have any further questions, please let me know.

AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE TNS GROUP, AN OMEGA SYSTEMS COMPANY
Steven,
We are contacting you regarding your existing Microsoft 365 monthly subscription licenses that fall under Microsoft’s CSP legacy commerce platform. Microsoft has notified its partners that effective January 1, 2024, Microsoft will be retiring its CSP legacy commerce platform and will begin migrating all legacy subscription licenses to Microsoft’s new commerce experience (NCE) platform.
Under NCE, Microsoft defaults to an annual (committed) subscription and offers an optional monthly (non-committed) subscription, with the month-to-month option incurring up to a 20% premium. Please see the details below.
[image]
* Please respond to this email as soon as possible if you would like to change your month-to-month subscription term to an annual one-year commitment subscription term.
* If your organization requires the flexibility to reduce the user count monthly, please contact me immediately to explore the monthly non-committed option.
* If we do not hear from you prior to December 8, 2023, your existing subscription licenses will automatically be migrated over to the NCE platform on a month-to-month subscription term with up to a 20% premium starting January 1, 2024.
If you have any questions regarding this transition, please do not hesitate to reach out. We are here to support and guide you through the transition process.

We can revisit at any time, but if you go with the annual licensing, Powerhouse will need to pay the licensing for 1 year. In doing so there will not be a price increase. If you have any further questions, please let me know.
Warm regards, Erika

Hi Steven,
If you want to cover off on this topic on our monthly next Wednesday, we can review at that time and then determine next steps if that is better for Powerhouse.
If not, we will migrate everything to Annual as requested. If you want to review licensing in December, we can do so, but the changes will not be implemented until late December before January 1st.
Let me know what is best for you. Thank you, Erika

AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE TNS GROUP, AN OMEGA SYSTEMS COMPANY
Steven,
We are contacting you regarding your existing Microsoft 365 monthly subscription licenses that fall under Microsoft’s CSP legacy commerce platform. Microsoft has notified its partners that effective January 1, 2024, Microsoft will be retiring its CSP legacy commerce platform and will begin migrating all legacy subscription licenses to Microsoft’s new commerce experience (NCE) platform.
Under NCE, Microsoft defaults to an annual (committed) subscription and offers an optional monthly (non-committed) subscription, with the month-to-month option incurring up to a 20% premium. Please see the details below.
[image]
* Please respond to this email as soon as possible if you would like to change your month-to-month subscription term to an annual one-year commitment subscription term.
* If your organization requires the flexibility to reduce the user count monthly, please contact me immediately to explore the monthly non-committed option.
* If we do not hear from you prior to December 8, 2023, your existing subscription licenses will automatically be migrated over to the NCE platform on a month-to-month subscription term with up to a 20% premium starting January 1, 2024.
If you have any questions regarding this transition, please do not hesitate to reach out. We are here to support and guide you through the transition process.

something stronger for after 5p!).
Do any of these dates/times work for you?

Wow. I don't get that.
On brightgauge the way it works is that there's a dashboard for various
metrics.
Each gauge on the dashboard is independent and you can subscribe to it.
If a gauge breaks for some reason (the report no longer runs correctly)
then you get the kind of thing that you experienced.

Hi Steven?
Sounds good, in terms of shipping should we send it to Powerhouse? I believe Powerhouse may be closed between Christmas and New Years – should we ship the first week of January?
Let me know what is best.
Also, we will need a form completed for the replacement build.
https://thetnsgroup.com/request/
I provided the generic form for ease, and you can choose the dropdown from the menu. You can always use the customized form but I thought that since this is a straight replacement this may be easier.

Hi Erika,
Adding +Katie Coughlin here -
Yes! We should replace as it's out of warranty, and the battery is expanding -
@Katie Coughlin, given your current workload, do you need a lighter-weight 13" machine that's strong, or a larger 14" machine that packs a bit of a weightier punch in terms of processing power? How much design/creative cloud work do you do on a regular basis on your machine?

David and Steven,
I hope you had a great weekend!
A ticket was submitted to our Procurement team for Katie Coughlin at Powerhouse. The battery is expanding, it is out of warranty and is 4 years old. There was some question as to whether Powerhouse was responsible for replacing it. It looks like Powerhouse has a MBP 14 in inventory and some MB Air 13"s. Do they want to replace it with one out of inventory, quote a new one or have the user get one on their own?
Please advise.
Many thanks, Erika

@Katie Coughlin , given your current workload, do you need a lighter-weight 13" machine that's strong, or a larger
14" machine that packs a bit of a weightier punch in terms of processing power? How much design/creative cloud work do you do on a regular basis on your machine?

Sounds good, in terms of shipping should we send it to Powerhouse? I believe Powerhouse may be closed between Christmas and New Years – should we ship the first week of January?
Let me know what is best.
Also, we will need a form completed for the replacement build.

I provided the generic form for ease, and you can choose the dropdown from the menu. You can always use the customized form but I thought that since this is a straight replacement this may be easier.

David and Steven,
I hope you had a great weekend!
A ticket was submitted to our Procurement team for Katie Coughlin at Powerhouse. The battery is expanding, it is out of warranty and is 4 years old. There was some question as to whether Powerhouse was responsible for replacing it. It looks like Powerhouse has a MBP 14 in inventory and some MB Air 13"s. Do they want to replace it with one out of inventory, quote a new one or have the user get one on their own?
Please advise.
Many thanks, Erika

Can you prepare a price and ETA estimate for:
3 x iPad Air or iPad 10th Generation (10.9")
the number on that may change +/-1
Before it goes to Steven, I want to prepare a statement about which departments and for what purpose.
I should be able to finalize this into a proper detailed request by Monday, but I'd like the approximate cost and ETA to run by Steven first.

Good morning TNS,
I was just issued a new laptop this week, and currently do not have access to any Microsoft 365 software (see screenshot below). I desperately need access to both Word and Excel today in order to do my job, so I would greatly appreciate regaining this access
as soon as possible.
Thank you for your support!

Hi David,
Yes, the online generator test went well last night and thanks for
connecting with TNS for us.
The UPS for the ISP is in the main server room located near the security
desk, I will switch this when I get back to the office on Monday November
27.
Since it's on a UPS I assume I can just move the plug and there should be
no issues.
Additionally, I will also switch the gatehouse computer to the outlet
served by the generator on Monday.
I look forward to catching up with you when you're back in the office.
Have a safe, healthy and happy holiday,
Mitch

Mitch:
I'm glad the generator test seems to have gone without a hitch!
Congratulations.
There's one item that Robert (copied) noted:
The ISP UPS (I'm not sure of the location) and the Guard House USP should
be plugged into generator-served outlets; currently they are plugged into
outlets not served by the generator.
Can you handle this?
Robert's full notes are below.
PS - I also spoke to Robert about meeting your requirements for WiFi in the
Guard House and Garage, and I'll pick up that discussion as soon as I get
back next week.
Thank you all, and have a great Thanksgiving.
I am grateful to have met you in these past few weeks, and grateful to be
able to work with such a fabulous team of smart, interesting, dedicated
people. Thank you.

Hello Team,
I just wanted provide an update on yesterday’s generator test.
At 4:30PM. Myself and fellow TNS Engineer Aaron Goldring arrived onsite.
Aaron was brought along so that he may be aware and familiar with the site
as well.
A walk through was conducted on IT closets throughout the building to
ensure all devices were connected directly to PDU or Battery backup and not
to any Normal receptacles.
Was also advised AV support was on site and all their equipment located in
AV closet on 3rd floor was manually shutdown by AV techs.
Upon walk through it was discovered the Guardhouse was on battery backup
but the UPS was plugged into normal power. An outlet nearby maybe on
generator power but will need to be verified by In House engineering before
swapping over.
The Primary ISP line in the MDF is on their own battery backup however
that UPS is plugged into a Normal receptacle.
All security servers have the option of redundant power supplies but only
one power supply was used.
TNS added extra power supplies that were brought over to ensure power
redundancy on all servers and network equipment that allow for that.
At 5:15 coned power was shut down and generator power kicked in. All
equipment in MDF remained on line. As to be expected Primary ISP circuit
went on to dedicated battery back up.
Walk through was performed and confirmed all IT closets remained on line
and all Wireless APs were up and functioning.
Internet was still accessible throughout power shutdown.
Guardhouse equipment also stayed up while on battery backup.
At 6:15 coned power was restored to building and all equipment remained on
line during switch. No network outages through out process.
All devices that utilized battery backup showed about 20% availability
after 1 hour of battery backup. At current rate uptime will be for a little
less than an hour and half.
*Final remediation objectives:*
Primary ISP Backup:
ISP UPS should be either added to generator outlet via power cord adapter
or via extension cord to rack PDU
Guard House battery:
Internal Engineers need to determine if receptacle not labeled as normal is
indeed on generator backup and if so will need to move over UPS connection.

Thanks for this update, Robert, and for keeping me updated during the test.
I'll forward some of these items over to facilities and then let's follow
up when I'm back next week.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY FROM OMEGA SYSTEMS
David,
Please take a few moments to review some of the content we’ve included in this month’s Omega Systems customer newsletter, and don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback.
In this issue:
- Why Aren’t More Companies Adopting Generative AI?
- Service Spotlight: Cloudpath
- [PRODUCT WEBINAR] Cloudpath 101 – Exclusive to Omega Customers

Finally, as a reminder, Omega Systems’ corporate offices will be closed on Monday, Sept 2nd to celebrate the upcoming Labor Day holiday. As always, our Service Desk will continue to operate with normal after-hours and holiday support coverage for customers requiring these services.
Thank you,
Erika
Why Aren’t More Companies Adopting Generative AI?
Omega COO Ben Tercha publishes first article on Forbes.com
We’re pleased to share that Omega’s Chief Operating Officer, Ben Tercha, is now a member of Forbes Technology Council – an exclusive community for CIOs, CTOs, and technology executives. Following is a brief excerpt from his first article (https://email.omegasystemscorp.com/e3t/Ctc/2O+113/d2MMPQ04/MWRgv_5jBtyW40xr5y75wlsTW7jDgJ35kkd82N3fD2Cg5m_5PW5BWr2F6lZ3pYW3zp4Mt6FZzG_W42HwJb2xn_nKW1mMc4b8Rpn9FN3MTWqHX0P2ZW1SF2tK77SpYGW7yw_dD96BSL1W7K2B9d8HbPv4N45sm9_8zHmQN4z4g-7V28MXW23tRbL6FP0GDVYrK6v7ylj4bVl7spG7pCChrW9cgC5P6TSWWpW4gNP4S4BZPPDVcbThl8CzxTjVVRbg0652LxkW2lMRxh2vwz4sW4GMqv55sy6MDW3N2b-27YlWMWW22k6v469Q9wpW1_WJR41lWM9-V86WHy3wjXWGN6TyQf584-SbW33gjCs83M1MFW4D4rzC8SBLTpW10nsl552KfLHVzDQSQ19vdMbVjV0LF4qh18PW3tfVg35dKyt8W1sLD9c8XppBqW86D5Sz62vHqWW2N7wDN6csFzYN5HhZ-wSMvGKW7D_vRJ2Y4wQyf2DwV1q04 ) in which Ben speculates about some of the reasons businesses are slow to adopt generative AI solutions like Microsoft Copilot.
“Seemingly, everywhere you turn, the dominant conversation topic is generative AI. Discussion groups, webinars, conferences, email newsletters—it’s the subject everyone wants to talk about. While the excitement and hype seem to be glaringly present in these virtual forums, it’s a sharp contrast to the level of interest and utilization we’re seeing in the real world...
Admittedly, we’ve been encouraging our customers to pace themselves with AI adoption, primarily to ensure they focus on reviewing and implementing security and data privacy measures before giving generative AI unrestricted access to their environment. But if our customer base is in any way a representation of the broader marketplace, then perhaps we should be thinking about why. There are a few obvious reasons that come to mind.”

NEW & NOTEWORTHY FROM OMEGA SYSTEMS
David,
Please take a few moments to review some of the content we’ve included in this month’s Omega Systems customer newsletter, and don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback.
In this issue:
Why Aren’t More Companies Adopting Generative AI?
Service Spotlight: Cloudpath
[PRODUCT WEBINAR] Cloudpath 101 – Exclusive to Omega Customers
Guide to Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) Security
Finally, as a reminder, Omega Systems’ corporate offices will be closed on Monday, Sept 2nd to celebrate the upcoming Labor Day holiday. As always, our Service Desk will continue to operate with normal after-hours and holiday support coverage for customers requiring these services.
Thank you,
Erika
Why Aren’t More Companies Adopting Generative AI?
Omega COO Ben Tercha publishes first article on Forbes.com
We’re pleased to share that Omega’s Chief Operating Officer , Ben Tercha , is now a member of Forbes Technology Council – an exclusive community for CIOs, CTOs, and technology executives. Following is a brief excerpt from his first article in which Ben speculates about some of the reasons businesses are slow to adopt generative AI solutions like Microsoft Copilot.
“Seemingly, everywhere you turn, the dominant conversation topic is generative AI. Discussion groups, webinars, conferences, email newsletters—it’s the subject everyone wants to talk about. While the excitement and hype seem to be glaringly present in these virtual forums, it’s a sharp contrast to the level of interest and utilization we’re seeing in the real world...
Admittedly, we’ve been encouraging our customers to pace themselves with AI adoption, primarily to ensure they focus on reviewing and implementing security and data privacy measures before giving generative AI unrestricted access to their environment. But if our customer base is in any way a representation of the broader marketplace, then perhaps we should be thinking about why. There are a few obvious reasons that come to mind.”

Subject: 11/29/23:  Powerhouse (PH) Monthly Meeting and Action Items

Hi all, thank you for your time yesterday. Please let me know if you have any updates/changes or questions with the meeting notes below. Thank you, Erika
11/29/23: Powerhouse (PH) Monthly Meeting and Immediate Action Items
In attendance: David, Rob, Dan, and Erika
1. S/W, H/W Reporting status
* Hardware that TNS manages was provided in the shared hardware document (David reviewed on the call - no further action at this time)
* Software stats - Rob is actively working on this and will provide everything that we have access to
* Purpose: David wants to turn this into a catalogue for users, so they have insight into the approved applications
* PH has specific applications that TNS only has access for onboarding and will have to grow and learn with users as we are not "application specialists" across all platforms
* There were application champions in the past (Ben, Paul)
* Purpose of Hardware reporting
* Determine what TNS is managing and what other players are managing systems (AV, security, etc.)
* Need to know who is managing Genentech, and if machines are being updated
* Once David has a tighter picture, we can determine where TNS gets involved - full life cycle or simply putting an image on laptops - TBD
* David needs TNS with fact findings and we are more than happy to support those initiatives
1. Contact Information
* TNS is willing to do another onboarding for TNS and Powerhouse
* Concern that users are not sending to the correct addresses:
* Mitch has my address in his address book as support@thetnsgroup.com instead of eellis@thetnsgroup.com (I am not getting his emails)
* Finance sent a request to TNS@powerhousearts.org - it should go to support@thetnsgroup.com
1. Onboarding
* Per David and TNS, we have a process in place that works well from a process standpoint
* TNS build lead timelines (see attached)
* Onboarding forms must be complete and confirm if the user is getting a new machine
* Dan reaches out to Yarisbeth to clarify the form submission when needed
* Dan meets with users on Wednesdays when he is onsite to do a deep dive into the onboarding; he calls them on their first day to make sure the user can get into their software and machine
* David to build parameters into the process to makes sure that communication on both sides is clear
1. Brightgauge Ticket and Inventory (Addigy) Reporting
* Rob walked David through how to access and use Brightgauge (post our call), which will provide him ticketing information and the Mac inventory (pulled via Addigy) and other data.
* Rob resent the invitation for the platform
1. POM status for Door APs/other
* David has a contact at POM via Mitch so he can get clarity on the POM side
* This will help clarify what is out there, who is managing it and will develop an overall map of devices on the network for security and management purposes
1. OS Upgrades - Print Shop
* Dan setup the two new iMacs and deployed them
* Machines comply, but need to determine what to do with the old machines (most TNS clients use https://www.4thbin.com/ for recycling purposes
Action:
* Dan to determine if there are any further print shop devices that need OS upgrades/or PH in general and alert David for next steps
1. Tickets
* Wi-Fi at Gatehouse - #5232506 - Wyze Camera and Access Point (resolved during a separate meeting today)
* Mitch with Kode Labs - Service Ticket #5226123 -
* Erika reached out to Mitch and copied David to determine next steps - TNS is not authorized to implement a new SaaS for the Building Management System without approval from David or Steven
* Salesforce Login - #5201123
* Resolved; Megan asked David (Admin for Salesforce) to give access to Julia T and it was provided
1. Ticket Process
* Escalation via Account Manager (AM - Erika)
* Submit tickets prior to Dan going onsite so we can prioritize
* David can do a quick spot check on Tuesdays, so Dan is aware of priorities and that is the first in queue
* We do not want staff waiting for a resolution until Dan gets onsite - he is pulled in many directions
* Few steps needed to tighten this up; David will support this initiative as he understands the ticketing process overall over time
* David to work with TNS as needed and provide protocol to users over time
1. Network Questions
* Overall Wi-Fi coverage -
* Handled through POM
* David wants to know how the Wi-Fi coverage looks
* Rob noted 2 Meraki's side by side that can be separated
* The Access Points are smart APs and if they are close to teach other, one will reduce its power so there is no overlapping
* Not too much overlapping
* Most APs are auto sensors
* Need to get cameras on separate SSID and start analyzing the rest of items so they are not taking over bandwidth
* EnGenius APs for the doors
* EnGenius is on Zigbee or Z-Wave
* Davd needs some clarity from POM, i.e., respond time on the Schlage door locks that are controlled and connected to the gear, but not to TNS network
Action:
* David to get clarity from POM on Access Points

Subject: Re: Ticket#5441551/Powerhouse/PoE on elevator cameras -- has been updated

Hi TNS Group,
Thank you for letting me know this !
Last week I bought new ethernet adapters for the 2 elevators that the
cameras weren't working in and hooked them up in the elevator lobby X1
elevator and the other one in the Y2 elevator. Only the X1 elevator camera
started working again. I checked the IT closet on the 5th floor and see
that both Y! and Y2 blue cat 5 cables are plugged in. Additionally I
swapped out the cameras in the Y1 and Y2 elevators and the cameras are
working ok. Can you please verify that the cat 5 cables are plugged into
the correct ports ? I have already contacted my security vendor and they
don't know whats wrong at this point and asked that I contact you. On the
ethernet adapter the TWP light that is supposed to be on is not on. I
unplugged the transformer and then plugged it back on and this TWP light
goes on and then goes back off. I believe this light should be on since the
adjacent elevator that is working has this TWP light on.
Thanks for your help,
Mitch

Dan when you're onsite:
As you know, Eugene at PoM requested that the cat6 going to the 4 elevator cameras should have PoE DISABLED.
Please trace and label the relevant cat6 cables (4 of them?) in the IT closets, and label the ports that should be PoE disabled.
Prior to changing anything, please advise whether PoE is currently on for the elevator cameras that are working.
And, if possible, can Mitch or someone from the team can visually inspect the 2-wire device on the working elevators to see if it shows a PoE indicator light and if it is plugged in to a transformer.

Subject: PH:  For Rob Nieves - Monitoring alerts for David 

Hi Rob,
Per our meeting with David, we had discussed providing David monitoring alerts for anything impacting users. Below are notes from our last meeting. Please let me know if you have any questions.
1. Network Monitoring
* David does not want all monitoring alerts
* He wants monitoring from Meraki - web hook for monitoring
* For any outages Ph has an email of status alerts and another is a web hook to Slack for alerts
* He wants to capture email or web hook alerts and David can filter them down - specifically he wants to be made aware of any outages that impact users directly
* Rob to investigate this to ensure that David gets the monitoring alerts needed

Rob is going to respond to your previous emails. He will be onsite on 11/21 by 430, and he will do a walk through on all equipment. The APC and UPS should keep us up. Rob is out tomorrow, please review his responses.
We will need to reschedule the Brightgauge reporting after Thanksgiving – please provide some dates and times that work for you.
In terms of the software and hardware reporting we are hoping to get that to you before Thanksgiving.
Please let me know if you need anything else. Thanks, Erika

Thanks for the follow up!
Dan asked Cogent (?), the ISP, for a technical incident report of the
disruption I found documented on downdetector.
Once Cogent tells you what happened, I'd be happy if we can find a way to
alert on that class of problem, so next time we can be first inside the
organization to catch it.
question.
The following people reported issues
- Megan Skidmore
- Jenn Choi
- Steven Battaglia
- Luther Davis
- David Koosis
Megan, Jenn, Steven, Luther were probably on their TNS-managed Airbooks,
for which you should have MAC addresses.
I was on an HP Chromebook, no doubt the only one on the network. I can look
up the MAC tomorrow if that's useful.
Everyone except Luther was on the 2nd floor. Luther was on the 4th floor.
I notice that I *was* getting slack messages from these folks, by the way,
so... maybe DNS hiccup?
Thank you for looking into this.

Hello David,
We have several methods of monitoring your ISP and Network equipment.
PRTG is our monitoring software for your ISP.
We have probes that will continuously ping the ISP IP’s. Should an ISP go down, a ticket is automatically generated and handle by our team. These come in as code red and are handled promptly. POC’s are always notified in these scenarios.
As you will see from the Graphs below, there were no packet loss on 1/9 and 1/10, thus no alert was sent to us.
[[A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]]
[[A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]]
For the internal network, we also have alerts generated from the Meraki systems should internal wifi or switches go offline.
This also showed to be stable during the outage indicated. Also with your two ISPs you would have failover, should the primary ISP go down the secondary would kick in.
[[image]]
We can try to do some more in depth analysis to try and pinpoint the issues with you devices at the time of the network delay.
Would you be able to provide the mac address or IP of the devices in question. I can try to see which APs those were connected to and see if there were any issues with the APs as well.

Hi David,

For any network concerns, our support team leads will escalate to engineering so they can review all facets of the situation in further detail. Yes, we have monitoring in place for the network and Internet. This is also on our agenda for next week to explain or monitoring so we can answer any questions.

I think it's wrong that the outage would be long enough for 3 users to message me, and Steve to walk to my desk, and I wouldn't be able to know or find out anything about it.
Do you have any sort of standard agent you use to ping from an internal computer to the outside world every minute or so, and raise appropriate alerts?

Hi Erika!
Can you please give me an accounting of our Zoom licensing from the perspective of meeting length limits, and options to provide people with longer meeting times?
If that's out of scope, can you tell me the name and contact info for the Zoom account rep?
Someone ran into a 40-minute meeting limit with Zoom yesterday. I was surprised and asked Dan to take a look and tell me the license terms. It's true. At least some of our licenses are limited to 40 minute meetings, which is just short enough to be unacceptable.
I know Zoom changed terms back in July. Perhaps we have new or expiring accounts that are starting to run into the new limits?
Thank you!

Hello David
After look into this outage it looks like all of devices remained online when the internet for cogent had a blip.
This why there is no alert for an isp link being down, to ensure all is well I reinstalled the PRTG probes that are connected to the switch at power house I will continue to wait to hear back from cogent to see why their internet went down.
Thanks

Hi Steven,
I hope you had a great weekend!
I was able to meet with my boss regarding the uplift. To go from 30 users to 60 users, the increase would be $3000 per month. As you know, we do NOT price per person. We encompass the entire environment, etc., and I was able to keep the pricing down. This comes out to $100/user/month – although again, that is not how we price things.
Again, I did not want to incur any increases until our partnership was stable and moving forward, which I believe we are in that direction.
I will take your lead on this, and I am more than happy to jump on a call at any time.
Warm regards, Erika

Hi Steven,
I wanted to circle back on our discussion regarding the uplift to account for the growth of staff/other. My apologies I could not get this to you sooner, December was incredibly busy. I should have the numbers to you within the next week and we can start the uplift in February instead of January if that works for you.
My apologies if the delay caused any issues.
Please let me know your thoughts – we can work on it together as always! Erika

AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE TNS GROUP, AN OMEGA SYSTEMS COMPANY
Steven,
We are pleased to let you know that we will commence with anti-virus (AV) solution migration during the month of May. Customers will be migrated to Omega’s endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution, powered by SentinelOne, during a two-day installation window, during which workstations and laptops should remain plugged in and powered on; laptop screens should also remain open.
Please note: [COMPANY]’s installation window is scheduled for [AV MIGRATION WINDOW].
To complete the installation, there is a planned reboot window expected from 8:00-11:00pm ET both evenings. We encourage you to save your work before signing off during each day of the installation window.
Omega Systems’ Security Operations Center (SOC) will be activated during the migration process and monitoring systems to work through adjusting exceptions and responding to false positives.
These changes will occur in the background, and users should not experience any impact during the migration window.
As always, if you have any questions, please reach out to your account manager.
Thank you,
All of us at The TNS Group, an Omega Systems company

I feel your pain! To be fair, I think his response is basically on target,
even if it wasn't timely or especially useful.
There's something about the file that's making it difficult to open for
other-than-the-official AutoCAD reader. Or something. Maybe it's unusually
complex -- the online reader took a solid 3 minutes to load the file.
If you have to handle a lot of these, may want to look into getting you a
higher power reader.
Or, it may be the sender could save it in a less complex format -- flatten
the layers?

Hi Pamela,
I tried to open the file using my DWG file viewer (eDrawings Pro) and I got the same result. Looks like the file is corrupted or there is a problem with the version or Compatibility on the app.
I suggest to contact the person who sent you the file and advise them that you are having issue opening it, or viewing it using your eDrawings reader app.
Please let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with.

Hi Pamela,
I tried to open the file using my DWG file viewer (eDrawings Pro) and I got the same result. Looks like the file is corrupted or there is a problem with the version or Compatibility on the app.
I suggest to contact the person who sent you the file and advise them that you are having issue opening it, or viewing it using your eDrawings reader app.
Please let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with.

Hi David and TNS support team,
I am having trouble opening the dwg file attached to the email forwarded here with my eDrawings reader App.
Can you take a look at it and guide me toward what is wrong here?
I have successfully opened other dfx and dwg files from the same sender.
But for some reason this one opens just in squiggles for me. In fact I am also attaching here a screenshot of what I am seeing when I am opening the file.
As far as things, I have already tried on my end these are:
Close everything and restart computer
Update google chrome browser and restart
This drawing happens to be important as it is the floor plan with chairs for our April fundraising dinner.
Thank you so much.
Pam

This is what I got back from TNS. Not very helpful!
Of course I already let the sender know that I was having trouble opening
the file way before contacting TNS,
So anyway: Your help was much better than their and I don't know what to do
with them and their ticket. guess I ignore it and move on.

Hello,
The Mac desktop at the front desk in the lobby won't turn on even though it
is fully plugged in. It is connected to an extension cord which is working
for an iPhone charge cable. I have tried to turn it on by holding the power

It was working perfectly fine when I left work yesterday evening.

Jacqueline Veliz was issued a computer sometime in the recent past.
She's experiencing a recurring intermittent slack popup. When she enters her password, it just prompts her again, in a loop. I've run into this before and think it had to do with permissions on the Slack installation (?):
Please
1/ diagnose and fix Jacqueline's problem.
2/ let me know if Slack is on the standard build image and whether there's something we should fix on that
Thank you

Subject: RE: LastPass Licenses

Hi David,
I am on PTO today and will not be available until Thursday.
1. In terms of the tickets, I the portal, can you provide me some ticket numbers and I will review when I return. Or we can schedule a meeting on Thursday or Friday to walk through it.
If you want this resolved timely, Dan will be onsite today and can review some of your tickets with you, if time permits. Or you have the option of reaching out to support to walk you through it.
1. Procurement is aware that the licensing was allocated and will close the ticket.
1. Rob/Dan will be able to confirm if we have admin access to LastPass
Either way, TNS was never given permission to provide LastPass licenses for Powerhouse, it was handled internally.
Per our recent meeting, prior to Paul leaving, it was reiterated that TNS to procure licensing for everything EXCEPT for Box, LastPass and Zoom
Per our last call, I believe that Powerhouse as reviewing whether they should provide LastPass for interns. I am not sure if that has been resolved at this time.
I hope that this helps and if you want to jump on a call on Thursday or Friday, just let me know.
Thank you, Erika

Hi Erika!
(Moving Steven to bcc, as I try to take this off his plate)
1/ When I enter the ticket numbers or names in the portal, I'm not locating the ticket. I also tried scrolling through all open and closed tickets, but no dice. Please explain and/or help me fix, so I can find tickets you reference in the future.
2/ Steve disabled 2 users, freeing up licenses, and I have invited Karyn William and Julia Tolo as new users in LastPass. Please update those tickets as appropriate.
3/ TNS appears to have admin access to the LastPass console. Can you confirm this is your understanding and is intended?
Thanks

Good morning,
Procurement was forwarded 2 tickets for Powerhouse onboardings. Both users need LastPass licensing. These licenses do not go through TNS. As discussed in the past, Powerhouse will need to contact LastPass to buy more licensing or determine if they have licensing that they can remove from user accounts.
Tickets:
5139745 - Karyn William
5134879 - Julia Tolo
TNS was not provided access to manage this licensing. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you, Erika

Hi David,
I am on PTO today and will not be available until Thursday.
In terms of the tickets, I the portal, can you provide me some ticket numbers and I will review when I return. Or we can schedule a meeting on Thursday or Friday to walk through it.
If you want this resolved timely, Dan will be onsite today and can review some of your tickets with you, if time permits. Or you have the option of reaching out to support to walk you through it.
Procurement is aware that the licensing was allocated and will close the ticket.
Rob/Dan will be able to confirm if we have admin access to LastPass
Either way, TNS was never given permission to provide LastPass licenses for Powerhouse, it was handled internally.
Per our recent meeting, prior to Paul leaving, it was reiterated that TNS
to procure licensing for everything EXCEPT for Box, LastPass and Zoom
Per our last call, I believe that Powerhouse as reviewing whether they should provide LastPass for interns. I am not sure if that has been resolved at this time.
I hope that this helps and if you want to jump on a call on Thursday or Friday, just let me know.
Thank you, Erika

Hi Steve and David,
+ @Karyn Williams
Could we please re-visit the conversation around purchase of an iPad or two for development & programs share use?
It would be amazing both teams can utilize it, but TBD if that will work for you and your team, Karyn.
This is the start of the FY24-25 Development Events calendar : I will need an iPad at EXPO CHICAGO (April 11-15) for print sales, and possibly, depending on lift from event producer hire and Ellie, for the spring (April 29/30 holding) artist celebration/benefit. Let me know if this can be a bundled and shared usage purchase or if I should plan to move forward with getting one for development.
Thanks!
Megan
Re-upping this as per our conv yesterday.
@Jenn Williams + @Karyn Williams , let us know if there are any other requirements/needs we should consider when spec'ing this out, or if @Karyn Williams, you think your dept needs any equipment for sole use.

Thanks, Steve. Looping in Jenn as we feel there's certainly crossover need for usage that we can share for the time being between Devo and CEP. It looks like the iPad Air or iPad 10th Generation (10.9") would work well.
DEVO Needs:
Primarily event check-in & use off-site: presentation sharing, at art fairs for sharing artwork details, processing sales, general browser/ email usage.
App usage anticipated:
zkipster - Check-In (or other platform TBD)
Arternal - art sales
Gmail
Salesforce
Jenn please feel free to chime in with what app needs you would anticipate beyond using for event check-in.
Thanks so much!

Hey Megan,
Yes, we've used TS for years - we used to license Office 365 and Asana through them, prior to working directly with the providers for steeper discounts at volume rates, and also having direct access to account management, etc. In terms of Apple hardware products, they typically only sell refurbished devices (see below screenshot). To be honest, I don't know if it's worth the discount for a slightly out-of-date tablet, versus buying what we need brand new from Apple, which will also allow us to buy an AppleCare warranty, which is our standard process. We have a direct relationship with Apple Business, and TNS procures on our behalf. This also enables devices to be automatically enrolled in our mobile device management system that TNS uses for monitoring and troubleshooting. Here's how we should move forward:
* Browse the lower portion of this page to compare ipad models side by side, and let us know what dimension screen you think will work best for your event check-in purposes (and @Amy Babcock what your needs are for site visits - I imagine you'll need a bigger screen, with greater resolution).
* Let David K and I know what screen size you each need, and on a typical basis what you'll need to run on the tablet. (What apps, how many apps will you have open at the same time, etc.). From here, we'll suggest a processing, memory, and storage spec.
* We'll submit a ticket to TNS for procurement for the devices - procurement takes a few weeks.
Thanks,
S

Hi David and Steve,
Have you heard of TechSoup? We used it regularly at RxART to purchase new tech equipment for a fraction of the cost; organizations need to join as a member - not sure what the annual fee is.
I would like to plan for purchasing an iPad for development's use for internal and external cultivation/patron events, future fundraisers, etc. It seems like it could make sense for an iPad to be shared between Development & Events or AEC, do you agree?
Thanks,

Let David K and I know what screen size you each need, and on a typical basis what you'll need to run on the tablet. (What apps, how many apps will you have open at the same time, etc.). From here, we'll suggest a processing, memory, and storage spec. We'll submit a ticket to TNS for procurement for the devices - procurement takes a few weeks.

I would like to plan for purchasing an iPad for development's use for internal and external cultivation/patron events, future fundraisers, etc. It seems like it could make sense for an iPad to be shared between Development & Events or AEC, do you agree?

Hello all
I confirmed that there is patches in the gate house, and we should be able to set up an access point out there
As for the desktop we are not able to log on to, it looks like we have to contact the security vendor to see if we could reset the password for it.
If not I could re image the computer using a usb. I will be in next Wednesday and we could talk about it then

I asked TNS to focus on generator test until that's done.
Discussed WiFi with Dan at TNS, and they have go-ahead to proceed, but some questions about specific technical requirements, to ensure you get what you need.
I think there's a patch cable going to the gatehouse for a PC (not under TNS management) and a phone, and that the plan is to split the port and install an AP mostly to serve an IP camera? I'd like to make sure TNS is clear about the end goal you expect. Will
discuss with them ASAP post generator test.

Can you please schedule a meeting Wed with you, Dan Lucas, me?
Getting the result you need requires sorting out both the PC management and

Hi All,
We simply need to be able to check email and view security cameras on the
desktop computer. The wifi supports a camera that the security site
supervisor can see to ensure that the guards are at their post and not
sleeping.
I prefer not to reach out to the previous security vendor as they were
already terminated. Is there another way to gain access to that desktop
computer?
A larger question is, can we add TNS support to the technology in the
gatehouse? I am not sure why it's not already included in TNS's scope.
Best,
Phoenix

Subject: 10/25/23:  Powerhouse Monthly Meeting Notes and Action Items 

Hi all, thank you for your time yesterday. Below are the notes and action items from our meeting. Please let me know if you have any questions, changes, or updates. Enjoy your evening, Erika
10/25/23: Powerhouse Monthly Meeting Notes and Action Items
In attendance: Steven, David K. David G., Rob, Dan, and Erika
1. General Discussion:
* One of David's charges is to look at the relationship to see what we can do to strengthen it, amid Powerhouse's growth to date and projected growth
* It is important to streamline IT across the organization
* They want to take a closer look at their needs to keep the growth and organization strong
* There may be gaps in IT that still need to be identified
* Need an understanding of what Powerhouse needs to be successful and where TNS fits in
* Sense is that what worked in the past will not work going forward - need to determine what that looks like and what the implications are for our engagement, and how to change it
* Overall goal: Work together to make Powerhouse successful and provide clarity on their needs
* David will collaborate with TNS to determine what adjustments may need to take place going forward
1. Wi-Fi Project
* Quote was sent for visibility purposes; TNS wanted to clarify the request and to ensure the cabling is in place should we move forward, prior to approval
* It was agreed to delete this quote - we are not going forward at this time
* When walking around, physical access points that unlock the doors are on Wi-Fi and some are responding slowly
* there may be a desire to add access points
* TNS was asked for additional coverage - 2 access points in the parking lot - they are not directly attached to the access system
* Concern that Dan is getting pulled in different directions and we need to do some realignment
* Any quote requests, TNS to walk away and alert to Steven or David so they can investigate further
Action:
* David to speak to Mitch to clarify his askes for the 2 Access Points in the parking lot
1. Doors - Access Points
* POM manages the doors
EnGenius access points are the square ones with the antenna and the one close to the doors was rebooted
* Dan asked Mitch and Dean to get POM on the phone to discuss the Wi-fi
* TNS does not have visibility into the doors, and we don't support it, POM does
* The doors go through POM
* It is on an EnGenius access point and there is a switch in the server room, and it connects to three (3) security servers
* No one knows how to access the Access Points and how to get into the security device
* Dan has reached out to POM multiple times, and they never get back to him
Action:
* David to facilitate the discussion with POM so we have a proper handoff of the Aps, server, etc.
* David to follow-up on this slowness with the doors
1. Inventory Access
* TNS shipped some machines directly to Powerhouse for testing purposes
* Those machines need asset tags
* Dan is going through all machines to ensure they are all tagged, and the asset tag number is implemented in Addigy
Action:
* David to work with TNS to learn about Addigy and how it works
1. Inventory Status/New Hires
* Per our discussion, TNS sent out a quote for 2 MacBooks and 2 Airs today and the quote was approved
* We have one basic machine available onsite (13 inch)
* Powerhouse is looking to replace Paul's position
* Two new hires:
* Lee Newton - setup by 10/30
* Karyn Williams - 11/6

Hi all, thank you for your time yesterday. Below are the notes and action items from our meeting. Please let me know if you have any questions, changes, or updates. Enjoy your evening, Erika
10/25/23: Powerhouse Monthly Meeting Notes and Action Items
In attendance: Steven, David K. David G., Rob, Dan, and Erika
General Discussion:
One of David’s charges is to look at the relationship to see what we can do to strengthen it, amid Powerhouse’s growth to date and projected growth
It is important to streamline IT across the organization
They want to take a closer look at their needs to keep the growth and organization strong There may be gaps in IT that still need to be identified
Need an understanding of what Powerhouse needs to be successful and where TNS fits in
Sense is that what worked in the past will not work going forward – need to determine what that looks like and what the implications are for our engagement, and how to change it
Overall goal: Work together to make Powerhouse successful and provide clarity on their needs
David will collaborate with TNS to determine what adjustments may need to take place going forward
Wi-Fi Project
Quote was sent for visibility purposes; TNS wanted to clarify the request and to ensure the cabling is in place should we move forward, prior to approval
It was agreed to delete this quote – we are not going forward at this time When walking around, physical access points that unlock the doors are on Wi-Fi and some are responding slowly
there may be a desire to add access points
TNS was asked for additional coverage – 2 access points in the parking lot – they are not directly attached to the access system
Concern that Dan is getting pulled in different directions and we need to do some realignment
Any quote requests, TNS to walk away and alert to Steven or David so they can investigate further
Action:
David to speak to Mitch to clarify his askes for the 2 Access Points in the parking lot
Doors – Access Points
POM manages the doors
EnGenius access points are the square ones with the antenna and the one close to the doors was rebooted
Dan asked Mitch and Dean to get POM on the phone to discuss the Wi-fi
TNS does not have visibility into the doors, and we don’t support it, POM does
The doors go through POM
It is on an EnGenius access point and there is a switch in the server room, and it connects to three (3) security servers
No one knows how to access the Access Points and how to get into the security device
Dan has reached out to POM multiple times, and they never get back to him
Action:
David to facilitate the discussion with POM so we have a proper handoff of the Aps, server, etc.
David to follow-up on this slowness with the doors
Inventory Access
TNS shipped some machines directly to Powerhouse for testing purposes Those machines need asset tags
Dan is going through all machines to ensure they are all tagged, and the asset tag number is implemented in Addigy
Action:
David to work with TNS to learn about Addigy and how it works
Inventory Status/New Hires
Per our discussion, TNS sent out a quote for 2 MacBooks and 2 Airs today and the quote was approved
We have one basic machine available onsite (13 inch) Powerhouse is looking to replace Paul’s position
Two new hires:
Lee Newton – setup by 10/30 Karyn Williams – 11/6
Print Shop Machines
There are some older Macs that do not work with peripherals due to age Those machines need an upgrade – Dan works collaboratively with Luther and at times, they do not want to do the upgrades
Some of the machines are old and don’t function
Because they have unusual peripherals – it is dependent on a several drivers and Luther thought some of the older Macs were not working with some of the gear
It might be fixed of they go to newer Macs
Print shop computer hard drives are full – they should move data to Box
Dan had a call with Luther – CPU was at 99% when trying to render a picture
Multiple things are happening on those Macs, and they are becoming bogged down
Action:
Daivd to look at this with Dan and write up a recommendation to Steven for print shop
OS upgrades
Several of the print shop are not upgraded – Dan is trying to facilitate this; those on the 12.63 is most likely an artist device
Dan is trying to get users to Ventura
Software Updates
Just deployed the new versions of Slack and Chrome – Dan is still at Powerhouse and going through to make sure all were detected for all machines online
He created the intern policy within Addigy and will put all the MacBook Airs in Addigy for each intern
Security Measures
Patching and security updates mandated by Apple is managed by TNS through Addigy
The older OS are out of security and not compliant – might have to take them and update
Dan can share in greater detail what scripts we are targeting, how they ran/run through a repository Cybersecurity is in our portfolio – reviewed during our Technical Business Review (TBR)
David worked at another organization and experienced a Cyberattack and this shifted his thinking of the level of security an organization should have
TNS has a strong security stack, and it is enhanced through our parent company, Omega Systems, with additional solutions and security experts
Action:
David to help TNS upgrade all machines out of compliance from a security standpoint
Brightgauge
Integrates our tools and ticketing into a dashboard that is easy to view and consumable
Quick snapshot of what we have
Warranties on the machines, Tickets for the last 30 days, who is submitting tickets, sub-types, etc. – all in real time
Rob built this for Powerhouse, so they have one dashboard to look at

Hi David,
You can request to purchase a machine via your customized form or our generic form (Paul used the generic)
https://thetnsgroup.com/request/
If you want to email a message to me or quotes@thetnsgroup.com directly, we will need the specs for the machine or specifics, i.e., MacBook Pro
For any Windows machines, we have standard specs for users.
Does that help?

That's good, Erika.
Can you remind me if there's a form or standard set of information you provide to quotes@tnsgroup.com?
Thank you
Hi David,
I tried to call you back so I left a message on your cell.
Yes, we can add extra verbiage in our quotes. However, I will need that verbiage prior to sending it to quotes@thetnsgroup.com to spec out the machine and will need to direct them on what to include on the quote. This is out of our standard process so I will need to make them aware each time to include the verbiage you are providing, which is not a problem. This is not automated; it is manually so it may not be perfect each time.
In the past, Paul would work with the user and loop Dan in to make sure we spec out the right system, then it was sent to me. This is along the lines of Dan working with Nellie.
We will do our best to handle this in the best way for you. I welcome your thoughts. I will be out of the office tomorrow and returning early next week. We can discuss further on our weekly call next week if that is best.
I welcome your thoughts, Erika

Yes, this is great.
I figured you'd consulted Nellie; Dan probably also mentioned it to me; I just wasn't certain.
As standard practice, if I include a few sentences of context/explanation along with the initial procurement requests, and tag that to include in the quote that goes to Steven, do you have a natural place to include that information?

Hi David,
When we got the request, I spoke to Dan to confirm if there are any special specs. He spoke to Nellie and the only request was for 16 GB on this machine. Dan reviewed the machine quote.
I copied Dan here if you have any further questions. Does this help?

Steven: When you get the quote for approval, do you see the initial request or context? I can't tell. Should we add it?
Erika: I can't tell from the quote if someone checked with Nellie that what we're procuring can replace the old computer, which she described as "a microsoft touchscreen ipad." Can you confirm?
Thank you!

Here's my original request:
Hello Team Omega:
Please assess Nellie's need, and initiate a procurement for review/approval. Thank you!

Hi, David. The PC I use for the embroidery machine is nearly dead. It’s no longer charging properly, and yesterday I couldn’t get it to turn on… this morning it at least is updating and on.
It hasn’t been maintained. It’s still trying to sign into dropbox, and I can’t remember when we made the switch to box, but before 2022…
It’s severely under capacity for what I need it to do… it’s basically a microsoft touchscreen ipad—it can’t crunch the numbers it has to do a lot of automated functions in the embroidery program. But it’s still useful for drawing things out manually.
It would be great to have a dedicated computer. I’m really not sure what hard drive capacity I need, but I can reach out to the software developer to ask. Our software should be updated as well to really get the machine running... It would be great if it can run photoshop and illustrator.

Just approved - thanks!

Hello Team Omega:
Please assess Nellie's
need , and initiate a procurement for review/approval. Thank you!

Hi, David. The PC I use for the embroidery machine is nearly dead. It’s no longer charging properly, and yesterday I couldn’ t get
it to turn on… this morning it at least is updating and on.
It hasn ’ t been maintained. It’s still trying to sign into dropbox, and I can’ t remember
when we made the switch to box, but before 2022…
It’s severely under capacity for what I need it to do… it’s basically a microsoft touchscreen ipad—it can’ t crunch
the numbers it has to do a lot of automated functions in the embroidery program. But it’s still useful for drawing things out manually.
It would be great to have a dedicated computer. I’m really not sure what hard drive capacity I need, but I can reach out to the software developer to ask. Our software should
be updated as well to really get the machine running... It would be great if it can run photoshop and illustrator.

I don't see the original ask -
The process I had set up with Paul Kim was that all asks for new /
replacement machines would come to him, he would vet it with Omega and
you/Goodman, if necessary, he would submit the ticket for procurement,
inform me in our 1:1 that a request was in process, then the quote would
come through from Erika, Paul would affirm all the specs were correct, and
I would approve from a budget spending POV.

Just to confirm, I just spoke to our security vendor today and all they
need is the internal wifi to hook up their camera.

I asked TNS to focus on generator test until that's done.
Discussed WiFi with Dan at TNS, and they have go-ahead to proceed, but some
questions about specific technical requirements, to ensure you get what you
need.
I think there's a patch cable going to the gatehouse for a PC (not under
TNS management) and a phone, and that the plan is to split the port and
install an AP mostly to serve an IP camera? I'd like to make sure TNS is
clear about the end goal you expect. Will discuss with them ASAP post
generator test.

Subject: For Rob: SAML/SSO for Powerhouse
Hi Rob,
Per our Powerhouse meetings, I will be sending each task on a separate ticket.
Priority for the week of 1/29 - is SAML Setup or SCIM provisioning for Powerhouse.
The goal is to go through the application list and see where SAML is applicable. We can work at one application to test SSO.
Primary/Starter Applications: Zoom, Adobe, Box, Asana, Slack to start.
David to setup a shared document with the applications (I have not yet received it). TNS to complete the list and determine which ones are SSO capable or support SAML.
Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you! Erika

Good morning TLS team,
The mail app on my MacBook Pro is not working. I've tried everything, going through all the motions of verification I get an error. The mail app on my MacBook Pro is not working. I've tried everything by going through all the motions of verification. I get an error stating that it's a 400 error. The server cannot process the request because it is malformed. It should not be retired. That's all we know. I've sent this email through the Web App Google
Please advise
Thanks

Good morning TLS team,
The mail app on my MacBook Pro is not working. I've tried everything, going through all the motions of verification I get an error. The mail app on my MacBook Pro is not working. I've tried everything by going through all the motions of verification. I get an error stating that it's a 400 error. The server cannot process the request because it is malformed. It should not be retired. That's all we know. I've sent this email through the Web App Google
Please advise
Thanks

Good morning,
Per Mitch’s previous emails, he requested that Rob be onsite on Tuesday, November 21st at 5:15 pm for an outage – see below. Rob is available to go onsite on 11/21 as needed, but it is a billable cost. I wanted to get your approval before reaching back out to Mitch. Please let me know if you approve and we will plan accordingly. Thank you, Erika
On Tuesday November 21 @ 5:15p along with my vendor I will be conducting an online generator test. This is when we turn off the electricity to the building and the electricity is restored to the building from the generator. As you know when the electricity is restored this can sometimes cause problems to sensitive equipment such as the servers due to the surge. I will be sending an email out to the Powerhouse Arts staff soon to tell them to turn off their computers 15 minutes prior to the start of the online generator test, shall I have them unplug them too ? Additionally, I think I should have a TNS tech on site during this time to check the UPS and in case something goes wrong as I plan to reopen the building at 7:00p since we are open during the week until 10:00p.

Subject: For Approval - Onsite at Powerhouse / Online Generator Test / November 21 @ 5:15p
Importance: High
Good morning,
Per Mitch’s previous emails, he requested that Rob be onsite on Tuesday, November 21st at 5:15 pm for an outage – see below. Rob is available to go onsite on 11/21 as needed, but it is a billable cost. I wanted to get your approval before reaching back out to Mitch. Please let me know if you approve and we will plan accordingly. Thank you, Erika
On Tuesday November 21 @ 5:15p along with my vendor I will be conducting an online generator test. This is when we turn off the electricity to the building and the electricity is restored to the building from the generator. As you know when the electricity is restored this can sometimes cause problems to sensitive equipment such as the servers due to the surge. I will be sending an email out to the Powerhouse Arts staff soon to tell them to turn off their computers 15 minutes prior to the start of the online generator test, shall I have them unplug them too ? Additionally, I think I should have a TNS tech on site during this time to check the UPS and in case something goes wrong as I plan to reopen the building at 7:00p since we are open during the week until 10:00p.

Hi David,
Are you looking to have Dan onsite on 11/21 instead of Rob? If so, I will need to speak to the team internally to determine how to handle should the environment/equipment not come back up properly.
Please advise. Thank you, Erika

Also, I wanted to note I get many calls from external clients meant for
Shayna and Pam. I'm guessing the clients are not regarding the extensions.

Hello all
It looks like with those users their personal numbers are hidden in zoom contact list and only showing the extensions.
Thanks

Also, I wanted to note I get many calls from external clients meant for Shayna and Pam. I'm guessing the clients are not regarding the extensions.

Hi all,
We are having some issues with Zoom numbers. Security is repeatedly reaching out to me to reach Pam Rapp. Upon investigation, I've found that several employees have the same phone number but different extensions. Is this normal or should this be edited? Also,
should we only be dialing extensions instead of numbers? Employees in question are:
Charmaine Gray (718) 522-1188 Ect 5789
Pamela Rapp (718) 522-1188. Ext 5762

Yes, exactly. Some specific tickets may not be visible, but you can always come to me with any questions. In addition, when Rob shows you the Brightgauge report you will be able to drill down on tickets there as well as it is connected to the portal.

Subject: Re: Getting SoftRIP running after Webroot removal (sn:305601)

Luther,
The installation I performed was an atypical manual installation attempting a workaround for the previous issues, but should work correctly.
I renamed the old installations folder and hide them, so use the most recent installation which exists in C:\wwrip80.
Having hidden the previous installations in a folder named "hide" (I believe). In order to get the previous settings loaded in to the new installation a few files and folders will need to be transferred.
I would like to connect once more over TeamViewer if possible to do some setup and house-cleaning to make sure you're up and running correctly.
Feel free to reply with credentials and I will connect and get it done for you.
Kind Regards,
Peter Fillmore

After entering your credentials you should be able to get
into SoftRIP.
Your shortcut on the taskbar is likely pointing to the
incorrect location now, you will want to update that.
If you would like some assistance getting everything set

Hello David
After looking over the ticket reports
The main issues look like to be with
Microsoft Office
Using Box tools and the app itself.
General Mac usage and how to use the activity monitor to see what is causing issues.
Calendar access and how to consolidate.
Ensuring applications are updated.
Explain not use google drive.
How to use slack channel to create tickets.
Sharing documents externally.
What to do when you run into space issues. Instead of deleting the data how to move it to box.
Thanks

Hi Mitch,
Thank you for your email. It does not look like any emails were sent to
eellis@thetnsgroup.com with regards to this. If you sent to
support@thetnsgroup.com , I am not automatically copied on those tickets, unless you add
eellis@thetnsgroup.com
to the email. Please copy me on any urgent tickets sent to support going forward.
I looked through all my emails and did not see any reference to this request.
The ticket request for this is documented (ticket #5107806) and it is in the status of “To Be Scheduled” and it was moved under Rob’s name. I spoke to Rob directly and he is actively trying to rearrange his schedule to make the 21 st
work. I will have a confirmation by early to mid-week next week. Does that work on your side?
Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns. I will reach back out once schedules are confirmed.

2. The OAuth scope is currently not listed. App access for google services is set to Limited for now but can be changed if necessary.
3. Access is available to users in the powerhouse.org domain, although we can change this to specific OUs if you would like to to restrict it further.

Hello John & TNS:
Arternal is unable to provide technical details right now.
Can you please:
1. go ahead and follow the directions Arternal provided,
2. report back what Google API Oauth scopes the app actually uses
3. confirm, if you can, that the access is restricted to named Powerhouse accounts

Hi David,
We reviewed the setup instructions and part of the process appears to be allowing Arternal to access all Google services. Can you provide more detail on how the email integration feature will be used, as well as any other Arternal features you may be interested
in utilizing?

Request
Configure Arternal with Third-Part App access on Powerhouse Google Workspace.
These are the directions from Arternal:
https://intercom.help/arternal/en/articles/5812133-linking-google-email-accounts
This is time sensitive, due by Tue Nov 14 -- earlier would be terrific. If that's not possible, please alert me. Thank you!
Background
Powerhouse has signed up with Arternal, a SaaS provider for art sales. To support integrated email (and some other capabilities?) Arternal requested access rights.
Additional Points of Contact
Powerhouse customer and point-of-contact for Arternal is: Megan Skidmore ( megan@powerhousearts.org )
Arternal point-of-contact (non-technical): Georgieanna Richer ( georgeianna@arternal.com )
Notes
Follow your standard protocol for these kinds of admin changes to Google Workspace, as far as any logging or permissions.
When you configure, please check if Arternal is requiring any "sensitive" or "restricted" Google API Oauth scopes, and whether access can be restricted to named Powerhouse accounts.
Thank you

Hi Georgieanna,
Happy to share that I was successfully able to send an email.
Shayna was able to link her email to Arternal as well.
Georgianna, as long as you don't see any issue on your end, I think we are
good to go, correct?
I will work on getting my contacts set up in CSV to send to you in the next
day.
Thank you all for your help in getting this resolved.

3. Access is available to users in the powerhouse.org domain, although we can change this to specific OUs if you would like to to restrict it further.

Powerhouse has signed up with Arternal, a SaaS provider for art sales. To support integrated email (and some other capabilities?) Arternal requested access rights.

Once an intern completes their internship, the laptops go back to the

Dan handles all the laptops and can advise you of their location.

Hi David,
Thanks for your response. Here's the SAML attributes currently used in your connection:
Attribute SAML_SUBJECT
Attribute FirstName
Attribute LastName
Attribute member-of
While it would be possible to ingest the attributes you mentioned coming from Google, there would need to be something to map them to on our side. Box does not store information such as department or title in the User Profile, so I'm not sure what we would use this information for. We do have a field for phone.
Regarding user provisioning, the way we handle this is documented HERE. Please take a look at this doc and let me know if it's something you would like to enable. Keep in mind we can only automaically provision accounts from our side, not de-provision.
Let me know if you have any questions about the above.

Ben

Hi David,
Thanks for your response. I can confirm that your current connection is the Google one. Unfortunately, after an IdP change, it's a known issue that the data in the Admin Console occasionally will not reflect the change. Fortunately, this is only a cosmetic issue, and can be safely ignored.

Hi David,
Thanks for supplying the metadata file. I can see that the Connection ID contained in this file matches the connection that is already applied to your enterprise. If you're happy to use this existing connection, you can enable SSO Test Mode under Admin Console > Enterprise Settings > User Settings > Configure SSO. Once this is enabled users will have the option to sign in via SSO or via Box credentials.
Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
Thanks,
Ben

Hi,
Thanks for contacting Box Support. My name is Ben and I understand you're looking to switch IdP from ADFS to Google. I can definitely assist.
Could you please provide the XML metadata file from the IdP? This will allow us to configure the connection on our side.
To answer your question, this will not affect user's ability to log in to O365.
Thanks,

Subject: WiFi networking questions

Rob
Can you educate me about these general networking questions when we next
connect?
Email or phone call is fine.
1. Powerhouse is an unusual office structure with lots of metal and
3-foot thick concrete walls, so I imagine WiFi performance is different
from a typical corporate office. Do you have a sense, or have we ever done
a walkaround mapping, of the overall WiFi penetration around the whole
building? Pretty strong? Any dead spots?
2. I see some spots like at the front door where we've got two AP's
right nearby each other. I think that predates your tenure, but do you have
any idea if that was done for a particular reason?
3. Do we use 2.4 as well as 5 ghz, and can you educate me as to whether
that makes any meaningful difference in a space like Powerhouse?
Are the motion sensors and locks and so on riding WiFi? Could we
partition those small-payload long-distance things to 2.4?
4. Is Meraki mesh, and can you educate me whether that makes any
meaningful difference in a space like Powerhouse?
Thank you!

Subject: Meeting request - ongoing potentially network interruption related problems
EXTERNAL EMAIL!!!
Hi Erica and Rob,
I wanted to ask whether it would be possible to get Rob, Dan Lucas, David and myself on the phone over these next two days?
Dan Lucas already has some knowledge of the Dante control network issue, but I am not sure whether or not he started a ticket.
Here is in a nutshell what is happening:
The transmitting and receiving devices communicate via a Dante system.
Currently we do not see all the transmitting devices on the network and we are unable to pass audio signal.
We are wondering whether there is a correlation between the "network incident" that occurred after the update of the Meraki routers and this problem?
We are also wondering whether the managed switches in the Audio racks are managed by TNS or not?
Also wondering whether there is any interconnection between these managed switches and other network equipment managed by TNS?
The background thought to all these questions is whether any ports might have gotten closed which require to be open for the Dante network to function?
The urgency of the situation is related to the fact that we have a new AV installer coming in on November 6 to do some punch list work on the system and we do not want to hand it to them in worse condition than it was handed over to us by the original installer.
Let me know when might be a good time for this.
Many thanks.
Pam

You are beating me to the punch with that question, David.
So far, the new AV vendor is only contracted to close out installation and
get the system through initial commissioning. We have not discussed an
ongoing service contract.

That sounds perfect, David.
Speaking from past venues, it is certainly possible that future issues will
occur (especially when equipment starts aging) and it is going to be a time
saver to have a process in place which everyone is familiar with.

Pamela:
Dropping TNS Group from this message.
Question: Who is the new A/V vendor, and will they have responsibility for
managing A/V network, SW & firmware updates and so on, similar to the way
TNS is expected to manage the computer network? Or how does that work?
Thank you

Rob:
Regarding 11/21 Powerhouse generator test, I know Steve gave the go-ahead to Erika regarding Mitch's request for you to be on-site.
Prior to the test, can you please confer with Mitch/Dean to get the test checklist and ensure that we include any relevant tech-specific items?
Are any of the following relevant?
- telecom or fiber failover protocols for which we need to coordinate with providers?
There are no Protocols currently in place. You have ISP handoff in the lower level MDF and on the roof. The power to the ISP equipment may be on a different circuit in the MDF on not on the APC on the Rack.
- Do we know if the static IPs on Pam's AV gear can handle a power bounce?
We have no insight into any AV or Security equipment. Those vendors should be notified as well.
- From past tests, do you anticipate any issues?
This will be the first time the test will be conducted to our knowledge prior to opening.
Do you know if Powerhouse has biz continuity or SOC audits that include power testing? Maybe we can kill two birds with one generator test.
We are unaware of any SOC audits pending.

As mentioned, Rob is offsite and client environments through end of day tomorrow. I am waiting for his confirmation for the onsite on 11/21.
I would like to reach out to Mitch and Dean to ask for a checklist for TNS to test when we are onsite to facilitate this. Are you ok with my moving forward with this?
Please advise. Thanks, Erika

Regarding 11/21 Powerhouse generator test, I know Steve gave the go-ahead to Erika regarding Mitch's request for you to be on-site.
Prior to the test, can you please confer with Mitch/Dean to get the test checklist and ensure that we include any relevant tech-specific items?
Are any of the following relevant?
- telecom or fiber failover protocols for which we need to coordinate with providers?
- Do we know if the static IPs on Pam's AV gear can handle a power bounce?
- From past tests, do you anticipate any issues?
Do you know if Powerhouse has biz continuity or SOC audits that include power testing? Maybe we can kill two birds with one generator test.

Subject: Re: Welcome to zkipster: Onboarding Next Step and Resources

Megan / Steven
Follow up on what I just sent, but excluding the vendors and including
Steven.
I want to be positive, problem solving, and forward looking, and at the
same time acknowledge this is not going as well as any of us want.
You want to send out a very important mailing today, and zkipster is not
configured as you need.
To fix this, I think we need someone to be responsible as administrative
owner of zkipster, responsible to make sure the system is running smoothly
and configured according to best practices. In our situation, I think Omega
(Dan) and I were assuming that Ellie or the zkipster onboarding team
configured the system, while Ellie and you, may have been assuming that the
network-related aspects were an "IT" issue. It's both. Someone needs to
understand how zkipster works, and to be responsible to ensure that the
networking configuration is as we need it, and also that the content that
goes out is produced in line with best practices for deliverability (ie, it
doesn't get flagged as spam).
TBH, my first instinct is still to say that Ellie should be that person,
because she's the marketing vendor with expertise using zkipster. I thought
she would be the one to advise you on how to use the tool and which best
practices to follow as far as composing and sending and email that is
spam-filter friendly. Does that make sense to you, or have I got it wrong?
Thank you for working through this with me. I'll stay on top of zkipster
and the DNS changes this morning and keep you informed.
/dk
I'm copying Steven because this relates to an important initiative (your
mailing) and to technology issues.

Subject: Re: Welcome to zkipster: Onboarding Next Step and Resources

We are waiting for zkipster "white labelling" to take effect, which depends
on zkipster being able to "see" changes that we made to our network
settings (DNS records) yesterday, which take a few minutes to a few days to
propagate around the internet.
I've been in touch with zkipster support last night and this morning to
monitor and see what they can do to speed up the process.
I see that our network team (Omega) made DNS changes related to zkipster a
month ago, following a request.
But those changes alone were not sufficient to enable zkipster "white
labelling." There are additional confirmation and configuration steps that
need to get done in zkipster, as the zkipster admin. (Note: only one user
can have admin rights on zkipster, and that's currently you, Megan; so we
are using your account with the credentials you shared.) These steps are
what we did last night.
Is there someone with zkipster expertise on hand, who can test the system
and verify that things are configured to meet your requirements? We want
that person to assist with your first big mailing using zkipster.
Separate, but related: with regard to our earlier emails about formatting
and configuring our email to avoid spam filters and increase
deliverability, I gave you my input on best practices, but this is
zkipster's bread and butter; is there someone at zkipster who can scan or
test the invitation to provide feedback on our first big mailing using
zkipster?

David,
I just shared the lastpass login with you and Daniel. Let me know if you
see the login and can get in.
I can't go through this tonight. I have a dinner to go to shortly and in
the morning I will be focused on getting our invitation personalized emails
out.
The invite to zkipster was shared with you and Dan awhile back and several
times I believe. I'm hopeful that you, Dan and Ellie can connect in the
morning to advance this and finally get the save the date out as this has
been weeks in waiting now.

Hi David,
Thanks for reaching out.

Hi David,
You should have received an invitation to join as a user already. Please
check your spam folder.
Ellie or Sam, you received this as well - if you can find the invite email
to share the Subject for David to look out for that could help.

Hi Jessica,
Thank you for confirming our account! Can you confirm that payment has
been received on your end? @Jasmine We will
look at our schedules and get back to you early next week about times to
connect for an onboarding session with you.
Ellie, have you had any issues in the time you have had to tap into the
draft campaigns? If not, hopefully you and I can connect to review set up
on Monday and coordinate some tests with Sam.
Thanks everyone! Have a great weekend!

Hey Team,
Karyn received this text to her personal number from someone who is saying
they are me. I am assuming they are setting themselves up to phish for
private information.
Please let me know if there is anything you can do. I was thinking of
sending a heads up to staff to make them aware.

Thanks Sam! And thanks for catching my glitch on the correct domain name:
powerhousearts.org
Both the security and branding behaviors apply to the whole domain, so
would apply to emails from info@powerhousearts.org as well as all
employees (sam@powerhousearts.org) or special email addresses (
sales@powerhousearts.org, jobs@powerhousearts.org, etc).

Hi David,
Friday's newsletter didn't see any abnormal bounces or unsubscribes, just
fyi.
I'm sure it doesn't matter in this context, but in your email you cited
powerhouse.org and powerhousearts.org; just pointing it out so we're
mindful in the future that our domain is the latter.
I obviously like the idea of our logo appearing in inboxes—hopefully you'd
be able to ensure that this works properly on the MailChimp side? For
instance, we have emails coming from info@powerhousearts.org and presumably
down the line we will have them coming from development@, etc. etc....
would it be applied across the board?
Thanks,
Sam

Subject: new email security standards implemented for Powerhouse

*Steven & Team:*
Couple updates re email.
*Email Security - DKIM/DMARC/SPF*
Dan recently implemented email security standards on our behalf (thanks
team TNS!). As David G brought to my attention, the big guys -- like
Google -- are starting to enforce certain email security standards strictly
for any sort of bulk email, like newsletters. Failure to implement these
standards can result in newsletters bouncing, and, potentially,
powerhouse.org getting put on a list of untrusted email domains.
So, it's a big positive step forward.
Technically, the standards are implemented as changes to our DNS records,
which broadcast our credentials to the internet's email infrastructure, and
make it difficult for spammers to abuse the powerhousearts.org domain. Here's
the best "explain it like I'm 5 years old" explanation I've seen:
SPF: These are the servers I will send from. If it says it's from me, but
comes from somewhere else, it's likely fake
DKIM: This is my signature, if it's not on the email, it probably didn't
come from my server.
DMARC: If you get mail that doesn't match the above, here's what I want you
to do with it..
@Sam - as the sender of newsletters, you are most likely to be impacted by
these changes. Please alert me to any notice you may receive from Mailchimp
regarding DKIM/SPF/DMARC, or any changes in bounce rates. I'll also check
Mailchimp's public documentation for any statements regarding their
requirements. If anyone else at Powerhouse sends email to, say 100+
recipients, please forward this email.
*Powerhouse Branding*
Here's the fun part. Implementing these security standards fulfills most of
the requirements for implementing another standards, called BIMI, which
lets us present certified branding in email. This wouldcause our certified
brandmark to appear in several places, notably, email inboxes.
These are the additional steps we need to take:
1. Register our brandmark. (It looks like we already have
.)
2. Pay an annual fee of about $1,500 to a certificate authority for a
"Verified Mark Certificate." I'm checking to see if Entrust
or Digicert have nonprofit
discounts.
The payoff is that your brandmark shows up in recipient inboxes and a few
other contexts, like this:
[image: bimim.png]
I think it's a good investment, especially now, when it's a distinctive
thing that not everyone does.
Steve: I'll take it offline for discussion with you.
Thank you

It's ok - I do it all the time. Yes, Karyn just joined as our VP Programs - this makes sense.
David, this is a bit backwards process wise, but at some point in the near-ish future, we do need to do an Adobe audit - lots of folks are requesting the full Adobe CC suite but likely don't need the full suite to complete their work (and I know several who have requested it for their own personal work). This one has always been hard to get a handle on. That being said, the expense isn't too great, so it can wait and I will approve these additional licenses. Also, I'd love to move people away from Acrobat and onto Preview as there's just an unnecessary expense for limited additional functionality.

There are an additional 5 for the interns for onboarding. We currently have temp licenses and we need to replace those with the Adobe licensing for the interns. Below is the chat with Dan with regards to the interns.

Hi Steven,
Five of the licenses are for the current users listed on the quote (see below):
There are an additional 5 for the interns for onboarding. We currently have temp licenses and we need to replace those with the Adobe licensing for the interns. Below is the chat with Dan with regards to the interns.
Lastly, Karen Petersburg asked Dan for an Adobe license. I can add that license to this quote upon your approval. If you approve, we will update the quote and resend. Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you, Erika

Hi Steven,
As a quick follow-up, I just got the quote approval for the 10 Adobe licenses originally sent:
5 interns and 5 users listed on the quote.
For Karyn Williams – we needed your approval to spec this out. If all in agreement, we will send a quote for 1 additional license for Karyn. That should do it!
If you agree, just let me know and we will get it out tomorrow. Thanks, Erika

It's ok - I do it all the time. Yes, Karyn just joined as our VP Programs - this makes sense.
David, this is a bit backwards process wise, but at some point in the near-ish future, we do need to do an Adobe audit - lots of folks are requesting the full Adobe CC suite but likely don't need the full suite to complete their work (and
I know several who have requested it for their own personal work). This one has always been hard to get a handle on. That being said, the expense isn't
too great, so it can wait and I will approve these additional licenses. Also, I'd love to move people away from Acrobat and onto Preview as there's just an unnecessary expense for limited additional functionality.

Hi Steven,
Five of the licenses are for the current users listed on the quote (see below):
There are an additional 5 for the interns for onboarding. We currently have temp licenses and we need to replace those with the Adobe licensing for the interns. Below is the chat
with Dan with regards to the interns.
Lastly, Karen Petersburg asked Dan for an Adobe license. I can add that license to this quote upon your approval. If you approve, we will update the quote and resend. Please

(Correcting email address);
Georgieanna: can someone on your team answer the question I asked earlier,
speaking to the security issues? or give me a quick call to clarify:
646-481-4141.
if Arternal is requiring any "sensitive" or "restricted" Google API Oauth
scopes, and whether access can be restricted to named Powerhouse accounts.
Probably, Arternal needs read/write to email, calendar, and a selected
Google Drive folder, for Arternal users at Powerhouse.
What the directions seem to say is that Arternal needs access to everything
from everyone.

Hi Tiffany,
Thanks—we just looked into it with David and apparently Eric is getting the emails but the link within the email's expired. Could there be a way to generate a new link that isn't expired?
Sincerely,

Hi,
He should have received the email, see below. Can you please ask Laura to sign? I saw that she opened the document but has not signed it.
The only other option I have is, once Laura signs, I can send you the document for Eric to physically sign, we are only allowed to use DocuSign to obtain signatures.

Hello Tiffany:
I'm the lead technical person at Powerhouse Arts.
I'm following because Jenn reported that you had some messages addressed to Eric and Laura at Powerhouse bounce.
Email between firstmanhattan.com and powerhousearts.org appears to be working normally.
Can you provide details about the problem messages?
If these are email messages, can you forward the entire error message? (If you need to redact account numbers or dollar amounts, that's fine.)
If you're able to forward the email headers -- the information with details about how and when the message was sent -- that would be terrific. Your IT support folks should be able to do that easily.
Thank you,
/dk

Hello Tiffany:
I'm the lead technical person at Powerhouse Arts.
I'm following because Jenn reported that you had some messages addressed to Eric and Laura at Powerhouse bounce.
Email between firstmanhattan.com and powerhousearts.org appears to be working normally.
Can you provide details about the problem messages?
If these are email messages, can you forward the entire error message? (If you need to redact account numbers or dollar amounts, that's fine.)
If you're able to forward the email headers -- the information with details about how and when the message was sent -- that would be terrific. Your IT support folks should be able to do that easily.
Thank you,
/dk

Eric let me know he is still not seeing this email in his regular inbox nor his spam. Tiffany, is there a way I could send this out through our internal e-sign platform and send
that to you with Eric's e-sig? Sorry this has been such an ordeal.
David, Laura, Eric, Steve, and Shayna are the internal email addresses for this account. I don't believe Tiffany has had issues with any other signer but Laura and Eric.

Thanks for that information Tiffany.
Email appears to be working correctly to Eric and Laura generally.
I think there's a problem --perhaps something temporary-- with DocuSign.
I'm most concerned that we rule out an ongoing issue. Are you able to try sending to Eric and Laura again?
To hunt down the issue we need to work directly with DocuSign technical support, because the issue is related to their emailing systems.
Are you able to get us a contact with your IT organization or DocuSign support rep?

Hi All,
Eric still hasn't received the DocuSign, would there be a way to potentially send that to his assistant? @David Koosis let us know what course of action makes the most sense.
Thank you,
Jen
Laura found the email in her spam folder. You should have her signature now or soon. Eric said he would check but I will follow up.
Hi,
I tried redoing the emails roughly 3 times and it seems to have work.
Jennifer, please confirm that Eric and Laura are able to see the emails and sign.
Thank you.

Thanks for that information Tiffany.
Email appears to be working correctly to Eric and Laura generally.
I think there's a problem --perhaps something temporary-- with DocuSign.
I'm most concerned that we rule out an ongoing issue. Are you able to try sending to Eric and Laura again?
To hunt down the issue we need to work directly with DocuSign technical support, because the issue is related to their emailing systems.
Are you able to get us a contact with your IT organization or DocuSign support rep?
Thanks

Hi Tiffany
That doesn't actually give us the information one would need. If the DocuSign system found a message to be undeliverable, it will have detailed information about what happened.
Can I ask, is this something you've resent successfully?

Hello Tiffany:
I'm the lead technical person at Powerhouse Arts.
I'm following because Jenn reported that you had some messages addressed to Eric and Laura at Powerhouse bounce.
Email between firstmanhattan.com and powerhousearts.org appears to be working normally.
Can you provide details about the problem messages?
If these are email messages, can you forward the entire error message? (If you need to redact account numbers or dollar amounts, that's fine.)
If you're able to forward the email headers -- the information with details about how and when the message was sent -- that would be terrific. Your IT support folks should be able to do that easily.
Thank you,
/dk

Hi,
He should have received the email, see below. Can you please ask Laura to sign? I saw that she opened the document but has not signed it.
The only other option I have is, once Laura signs, I can send you the document for Eric to physically sign, we are only allowed to use DocuSign to obtain signatures.

David, Laura, Eric, Steve, and Shayna are the internal email addresses for this account. I don't believe Tiffany has had issues with any other signer but Laura and Eric.

Thanks for that information Tiffany.
Email appears to be working correctly to Eric and Laura generally.
I think there's a problem --perhaps something temporary-- with DocuSign.
I'm most concerned that we rule out an ongoing issue. Are you able to try sending to Eric and Laura again?
To hunt down the issue we need to work directly with DocuSign technical support, because the issue is related to their emailing systems.
Are you able to get us a contact with your IT organization or DocuSign support rep?
Thanks

Hi Tiffany
That doesn't actually give us the information one would need. If the DocuSign system found a message to be undeliverable, it will have detailed information about what happened.
Can I ask, is this something you've resent successfully?

Hi,
Please let me know if he received the DocuSign now, I completely removed him and re-added him.
I also saw that Laura viewed hers but has not signed.

Hi All,
Eric still hasn't received the DocuSign, would there be a way to potentially send that to his assistant? @David Koosis let us know what course of action makes the most sense.
Thank you,

Laura found the email in her spam folder. You should have her signature now or soon. Eric said he would check but I will follow up.
Hi,
I tried redoing the emails roughly 3 times and it seems to have work.
Jennifer, please confirm that Eric and Laura are able to see the emails and sign.
Thank you.

Hello Tiffany:
I'm the lead technical person at Powerhouse Arts.
I'm following because Jenn reported that you had some messages addressed to Eric and Laura at Powerhouse bounce.
Email between firstmanhattan.com and powerhousearts.org appears to be working normally.
Can you provide details about the problem messages?
If these are email messages, can you forward the entire error message? (If you need to redact account numbers or dollar amounts, that's fine.)
If you're able to forward the email headers -- the information with details about how and when the message was sent -- that would be terrific. Your IT support folks should be able to do that easily.
Thank you,
/dk

Subject: following up regarding technical issue with email
EXTERNAL EMAIL. Please be cautious of links and attachments.
Hello Tiffany:
I'm the lead technical person at Powerhouse Arts.
I'm following because Jenn reported that you had some messages addressed to Eric and Laura at Powerhouse bounce.
Email between firstmanhattan.com and powerhousearts.org appears to be working normally.
Can you provide details about the problem messages?
If these are email messages, can you forward the entire error message? (If you need to redact account numbers or dollar amounts, that's fine.)
If you're able to forward the email headers -- the information with details about how and when the message was sent -- that would be terrific. Your IT support folks should be able to do that easily.
Thank you,
/dk

Hi,
Please let me know if he received the DocuSign now, I completely removed him and re-added him.
I also saw that Laura viewed hers but has not signed.

Hi All,
Eric still hasn't received the DocuSign, would there be a way to potentially send that to his assistant? @David Koosis let us know what course of action makes the most sense.
Thank you,

Thanks for that information Tiffany.
Email appears to be working correctly to Eric and Laura generally.
I think there's a problem --perhaps something temporary-- with DocuSign.
I'm most concerned that we rule out an ongoing issue. Are you able to try sending to Eric and Laura again?
To hunt down the issue we need to work directly with DocuSign technical support, because the issue is related to their emailing systems.
Are you able to get us a contact with your IT organization or DocuSign support rep?
Thanks

Hi Tiffany
That doesn't actually give us the information one would need. If the DocuSign system found a message to be undeliverable, it will have detailed information about what happened.
Can I ask, is this something you've resent successfully?

Hi Tiffany
That doesn't actually give us the information one would need. If the DocuSign system found a message to be undeliverable, it will have detailed information about what happened.
Can I ask, is this something you've resent successfully?

Hello Tiffany:
I'm the lead technical person at Powerhouse Arts.
I'm following because Jenn reported that you had some messages addressed to Eric and Laura at Powerhouse bounce.
Email between firstmanhattan.com and powerhousearts.org appears to be working normally.
Can you provide details about the problem messages?
If these are email messages, can you forward the entire error message? (If you need to redact account numbers or dollar amounts, that's fine.)
If you're able to forward the email headers -- the information with details about how and when the message was sent -- that would be terrific. Your IT support folks should be able to do that easily.
Thank you,
/dk

Hi Tiffany
That doesn't actually give us the information one would need. If the DocuSign system found a message to be undeliverable, it will have detailed information about what happened.
Can I ask, is this something you've resent successfully?
Here are the emails.

Hello Tiffany:
I'm the lead technical person at Powerhouse Arts.
I'm following because Jenn reported that you had some messages addressed to Eric and Laura at Powerhouse bounce.
Email between firstmanhattan.com and powerhousearts.org appears to be working normally.
Can you provide details about the problem messages?
If these are email messages, can you forward the entire error message? (If you need to redact account numbers or dollar amounts, that's fine.)
If you're able to forward the email headers -- the information with details about how and when the message was sent -- that would be terrific. Your IT support folks should be able to do that easily.
Thank you,

this old username and password for the Genetec system, Dan @ TNS already

Hi Dan,
Can you confirm if the computer at the gatehouse is supported by TNS? The
gate house security guard needs it to check emails and general
correspondence.
Best,
Phoenix

Gatehouse computer, I think, is not managed by TNS. At least, that's what I understood from Dan. (Dan can you confirm if I got that right?) Don't know if they can access.
Maybe installed along with Genetec?

Hi Clinton,
It's still an issue somewhere in my environment - is it cached in the Shared Contacts for Google app? See screenshot below from a test meeting I just attempted to schedule.

Good morning, Steven,
Thank you for the picture. You're right that is strange. I have checked Zoom just now - only Lisa Archigian is the only Lisa. Was Lisa Dent added to PHA x MGC meeting back in the day? This can be cached previously. But so far Lisa Archigian, email and Zoom
profile is fine. Let me know what you would like me to do next.

Happy Monday David, its Andrew at the helpdesk. I got word that Megan S. is looking to reset the Salesforce Multi-factor authentication because its currently asking her to put in a code from an authenticator app. Megan advised that MFA was set to send a code
to her email but now it seems to have changed somehow.
Do you happen to have Admin access for Salesforce to reset Megan's MFA by chance?

Yeah. Don't remove. She's been brought back as a consultant.
The HR system can't handle that...
I need to add a whitelist to the script logic.

Hi David
In speaking with Rob, he wants to get a greater understanding of how the BMS System /environment works. He is in the process of reviewing this and will get back to me. I must hold this request until I hear back from engineering – it should be timely.
In terms of requesting quotes such as a server, it must go through myself and from there it goes to sales engineering. Our quoting team will kick it back as the specs will need to be reviewed by engineering.
To reach procurement with any issues relating to shipping/other – NOT Quoting - it is procurement@thetnsgroup.com.
I hope that helps and I will circle back.
Many thanks, Erika

Hello Erika, and happy 2024!
Can you help me with a few things?
1/ I am considering installing a server (a small computer in one of the IT closets) at Powerhouse, under TNS management. It's for Kode labs. I believe this would be the first server under management, and I want to understand any contractual and cost impact so I can review with @Steven Battaglia.
2/ Can you provide a quote for the server under discussion? Kode recommended a NUC, which I think is fine for our purposes at this point; we don't need a fully racked pizza box. However, if TCS wants a fully racked box for ease-of-management, spec that too. Robert was on the call with Kode and has the specs they provided (or he should feel free to email them directly).
3/ Remind me of the dedicated TNS email address for procurement requests.
Thank you

Hello Erika, and happy 2024!
Can you help me with a few things?
1/ I am considering installing a server (a small computer in one of the IT closets) at Powerhouse, under TNS management. It's for Kode labs. I believe this would be the first server under management, and I want to understand any contractual and cost impact so I can review with @Steven Battaglia.
2/ Can you provide a quote for the server under discussion? Kode recommended a NUC, which I think is fine for our purposes at this point; we don't need a fully racked pizza box. However, if TCS wants a fully racked box for ease-of-management, spec that too. Robert was on the call with Kode and has the specs they provided (or he should feel free to email them directly).
3/ Remind me of the dedicated TNS email address for procurement requests.
Thank you

Hi David
In speaking with Rob, he wants to get a greater understanding of how the BMS System /environment works. He is in the process of reviewing this and will get back to me. I must
hold this request until I hear back from engineering – it should be timely.
In terms of requesting quotes such as a server, it must go through myself and from there it goes to sales engineering. Our quoting team will kick it back as the specs will need
to be reviewed by engineering.
To reach procurement with any issues relating to shipping/other – NOT Quoting - it is
procurement@thetnsgroup.com .
I hope that helps and I will circle back.

Hello Erika, and happy 2024!
Can you help me with a few things?
1/ I am considering installing a server (a small computer in one of the IT closets) at Powerhouse, under TNS management. It's for Kode labs. I believe this would be the first server under management, and I want to understand any contractual and cost impact so I can review with @Steven Battaglia.
2/ Can you provide a quote for the server under discussion? Kode recommended a NUC, which I think is fine for our purposes at this point; we don't need a fully racked pizza box. However, if TCS wants a fully racked box for ease-of-management, spec that too. Robert was on the call with Kode and has the specs they provided (or he should feel free to email them directly).
3/ Remind me of the dedicated TNS email address for procurement requests.
Thank you

Hi David
In speaking with Rob, he wants to get a greater understanding of how the BMS System /environment works. He is in the process of reviewing this and will get back to me. I must
hold this request until I hear back from engineering – it should be timely.
In terms of requesting quotes such as a server, it must go through myself and from there it goes to sales engineering. Our quoting team will kick it back as the specs will need
to be reviewed by engineering.
To reach procurement with any issues relating to shipping/other – NOT Quoting - it is
procurement@thetnsgroup.com .
I hope that helps and I will circle back.
Many thanks, Erika

Hello Erika, and happy 2024!
Can you help me with a few things?
1/ I am considering installing a server (a small computer in one of the IT closets) at Powerhouse, under TNS management. It's for Kode labs. I believe this would be the first server under management, and I want to understand any contractual and cost impact so I can review with @Steven Battaglia.
2/ Can you provide a quote for the server under discussion? Kode recommended a NUC, which I think is fine for our purposes at this point; we don't need a fully racked pizza box. However, if TCS wants a fully racked box for ease-of-management, spec that too. Robert was on the call with Kode and has the specs they provided (or he should feel free to email them directly).
3/ Remind me of the dedicated TNS email address for procurement requests.
Thank you

Hi David,
I don't see any issue on the ISP side and no packet loss seen on the circuit. All Wireless Access Points are up and online as well in the last 24 hours and no downtime.
Was the Wifi issue happened on all users or to just some users only?
Are you able to identify which part of the office or building having Wifi issue? Like in the classroom, hallway, Office etc?
If you can also provide me the mac address of one or two of the user's mac address or IP address then I will be able to trace it which Access point are connected. Thank you.
Regards,
Gem

Hi All:
FYI: it seems as if WiFi on PH Internal went offline for a minute within the past 10 minutes.
Can you take look and let me know if you see anything?

Subject: Upcoming New Hires

Hey Dan,
We have a couple of new hires starting in the next couple of days. Just
wanted to make sure they are set up for tech:
1. Leon Tchekmedylan, starting September 30th
Do we have any laptops on reserve for him, or do you think we should put a
quote in?
2. Marta Grasso is officially starting as a FT employee
3. Yayoi Shionoiri, new VP of External Affairs
4. Lisa Archigian, Director of MGC Community Print Studio
Only Yayoi and Leon will need laptops. Please confirm that we have it on
reserve.
Lisa said they received (2) laptops from Omega, so we should be good to go
with her.
Let me know if any tickets need to be included for these folks.
*All new hires should be set up: *
Zoom (including zoom cell #)
Slack
Email
Box
Access to the OOO calendar
However, this isn't always the case. Is there something we can do to ensure
that all new hires have access to these things?
Thanks

Hi Steven,
As a business owner, getting everything done on your to-do list each day is like running on a hamster wheel. Just as one to-do gets checked off, a new one gets added.
There is a tool that we highly recommend that reduces overwhelm by making managing projects 10X easier. Every client who uses it loves it.
This tool can replace half a dozen other tools, like Slack, Zoom, Asana and more, and has over 1,900 applications you can add in.
It is a game changer!
Find out what it is and how to start using it in today’s blog – read here!

Subject: Salesforce Login

Hi David and Dan,
When I try to login to Salesforce, it requests a verification code from the
google authentication app. I have the app and have successfully used it
before for logging into MailChimp but for some reason it is not working for
Salesforce. This is the verification message I get when logging in. Can you
please help me with this?
Thanks,
Megan

This is a friendly reminder about an upcoming update beginning the week of May 6th that impacts how you'll receive communications from us in the future.

All future communications will come from @ omegasystemscorp.com email addresses.
To ensure smooth delivery, please allowlist specific IP addresses (details included below) and keep a close eye on your spam folder.
Consider engaging with our emails (open and click links) to build trust with your inbox.
Full details and instructions were sent to you on 4/26 and are attached below for your reference.
Accounts,
As we proceed with integration and transition more systems and processes to Omega Systems, we want to share an update that will impact future communications like this one.
Beginning the week of May 6th, all legacy TNS corporate communications will be migrated to Omega Systems’ communication platforms. This includes:
All TNS-Omega integration updates
All marketing communications including customer newsletters, webinar invitations, etc.
TBR scheduling notifications & reminders
Other important news & updates including finance notifications, holiday closures, etc.
What does this mean for you?
To help ensure you don’t miss any future communications from the Omega Systems team, please review the following updates.
New Email Address: Corporate communications, including these integration updates, will no longer come from @ thetnsgroup.com email addresses and will come exclusively from @ omegasystemscorp.com .
Allowlist IP Addresses: Omega Systems uses Hubspot for all marketing and integration communications and has provided a list of all IPs that our emails from Hubspot may come from. If possible, please provide the following list to your IT team and request that they allowlist each in order to maximize your email deliverability rate:

Potential Spam Delivery: Of course, with any marketing communication system, there is a chance that emails might initially land in your spam folder. Please keep a close eye on your spam email and if you notice any Omega Systems communications, take immediate action to move them back to your inbox to ensure future delivery. It is also helpful to open and click links within our emails to help your inbox recognize our new address as trusted.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY FROM OMEGA SYSTEMS
David,
Please take a few moments to review some of the content we’ve included in this month’s Omega Systems customer newsletter, and don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback.
In this issue:
- Trend Watch: Preparing for Windows 10 EOL
- Top 10 Risk Assessment Gaps + 10 Proactive Security Tips

Thanks,

Trend Watch: Preparing for Windows 10 EOL
Our teams at Omega Systems are diligently reaching out to customers to begin preparing for Windows 10 end-of-life (EOL), which is approaching in 2025.
Utilizing EOL hardware and software can introduce significant concerns into your environment, which is why we want to ensure all Omega customers have properly upgraded their systems and infrastructure well in advance of the deadline. If you’re not familiar with EOL, the biggest repercussions you should be aware of include:
- Security risks due to lack of updates and patching;
- No technical support to correct bugs or issues; and
- Potential compatibility issues with other software/applications.
If you are still running Windows 10 on company workstations, you can expect to hear from your account manager in the coming weeks to discuss proactive transition plans.
Top 10 Security Assessment Gaps
The risk assessment process is a critical exercise used to identify potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities within your IT infrastructure, governance structure, or general security posture. Members of Omega’s Security Operations (SOC) team recently shared their unique perspective on risk assessments, revealing the 10 most common security gaps discovered during the assessment process – each of which can leave your organization vulnerable to cyber incidents.
- Gap #1: Lack of IT Security Governance
- Gap #2: No Tracking of Known Technology Risks
- Gap #3: Failure to Test Incident Response Plans/Conduct Tabletop Exercises
For the rest of the top 10 gaps and details on how to proactively address each before your next risk assessment, read our blog article (https://email.omegasystemscorp.com/e3t/Ctc/2O+113/d2MMPQ04/VWM0jG8gzfXQVYC8Yy7960XYW1PHNH55hYg9_N78Lwt45m_5PW5BWr2F6lZ3lLW9jShD37-z08zW3P05Vj25YXgmW5l-bsk93LvxVVppBzq8XtQy-W3T9dxz93zz9SW7V6Wp76vGhjdW2lcpx73WGGw6N4MVG-cTbtyrW37ZJVV6cqlVpW2Fcfg27wSX4jW8_lB3n2cKs0zW2HJKL-3SmNfLW14C1h34dlQ2HW99f0MP80KCv8W1S52ng80SjkRW2Yy32x832HXXW7LzB9G3VGDG0W2K0H8D5cvx2FN8vfPwn-2Dk-N7Yd_8CP3X71W5gxJxf7FSqbFW39_QyJ2wp9f_W47Qk3G5QvGcvVC5X9Y6Cg6wwW2NLdK28H3BJgW5VSM4K27VY4nW8Srwny1JPDJbN2fzp_nr8WrTW7WXXs31sxhZqW7qJ3d32_ZfdgN39Zb846SgF7W8jLy-n1jgxW5W3-h4S96_DMq1W2r5qFl60c6v0f8yqJST04 ) .

Subject: standard build - issuing new laptops

I have a document that lists the following desktop clients listed as
standard build for all staff:
1. Box
2. Office 365
3. Asana
4. Slack
5. Zoom
6. Lastpass
Is that accurate?
The last couple service requests I sent regarding Jacqueline Veliz's
computer had to do with Slack / Asana installs, I think.
Did TNS get a chance to do a standard build for her?
How can I help improve the process?

Steven and David,
Thank you for your emails, I appreciate it. With David speaking to Steve, we were able to make some changes in processes and protocol that will be beneficial.
In terms of the process for any outages, it goes to our Network Operations Center (NOC) first and it is escalated to a TAM, as needed. Steve and David discussed this on their call.
If there are any further issues/concerns, please let me know.
David, I will send today’s meeting notes no later than first thing in the morning due to back-to-back meetings.
Warm regards, Erika

Subject: Cogent outage / Omega response
CAUTION: This email originated from outside your organization. Exercise caution when opening attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders.
Overview
* Erika, Elvin (her supervisor) and I debriefed earlier today on the Cogent outage and our response.
* Meraki WiFi access points started throwing alerts about 5pm Monday. Presumably other alerts we put in place to monitor Powerhouse's internet connection also fired off. Omega determined that Cogent, our primary provider, suffered an outage which impacted many customers in our area.
* At the time of the Cogent outage, the automatic failover kicked in successfully, and Powerhouse switched to Brooklyn Fiber.
* However, there were shortcomings in communication. The status of the network, and the fact that we were up and running on our secondary almost immediately, was not clear, which led to confusion. This caused us to misinform employees, asking them to work remotely. When failover is setup, it should always failover to the 2nd ISP. In this case, we should have closed that loop and confirmed that the secondary line was up so there were no issues on the Powerhouse side. This was reviewed and discussed during our debrief.
Action Items
1. The security desk phone number is 718-354-8623. Please ask Elvin to add it to your response protocol in case the network team needs to check if power or WiFi is functioning off hours. We met with members of our Global team and our team will contact the security desk team for “Hands onsite” or other as needed.
2. I will coordinate internally to ensure security team is briefed. (@Erika Ellis - can you connect with Julia directly on #1 above, and to tell her how Security should alert Omega if they notice the WiFi is down off hours) @Julia – to reach the support desk for any issues, please contact:
· 212-967-5757, Option 2 or 203-316-0112, Option 2
· Support@thetnsgroup.com
· Call my cell at 203-981-8902 (to escalate/other)
1. Assess the communication breakdown that occurred and propose fix. (Why was it not clear to everyone that we were up and running on our secondary by Mon evening?) Elvin proposed some ideas about this. Ideally, I would have liked a call -- at any time 24/7 -- informing me that the network failed over to secondary and is working; and Omega is engaged with Cogent/Verizon and will update.
· David, you will continue to receive the alerts as the POC. Per our call, we informed our team to call you directly for any issues that impacts the building or an employee’s inability to work due to an outage, Wi-Fi down, etc. through proactive monitoring
Let's take a second to acknowledge the network failover worked as designed. That is excellent.
Thank you

* David, you will continue to receive the alerts as the POC. Per our call, we informed our team to call you directly for any issues that impacts the building or an employee’s inability to work due to an outage, Wi-Fi down, etc. through proactive monitoring
Let's take a second to acknowledge the network failover worked as designed. That is excellent.
Thank you

Hi David,
Thank you for taking the time to speak to Elvin and myself. We just had a team debrief to dive into this further. David, if you have time to jump on a call tomorrow, Elvin and I can provide some additional
clarity tomorrow. It should be brief.

Subject: Cogent outage / Omega response

*Overview*
- Erika, Elvin (her supervisor) and I debriefed earlier today on the
Cogent outage and our response.
- Meraki WiFi access points started throwing alerts about 5pm Monday.
Presumably other alerts we put in place to monitor Powerhouse's internet
connection also fired off. Omega determined that Cogent, our primary
provider, suffered an outage which impacted many customers in our area.
- At the time of the Cogent outage, the automatic failover kicked in
successfully, and Powerhouse switched to Brooklyn Fiber.
- However, there were shortcomings in communication. The status of the
network, and the fact that we were up and running on our secondary almost
immediately, was not clear, which led to confusion. This caused us to
misinform employees, asking them to work remotely
*Action Items*
1. The security desk phone number is 718-354-8623. Please ask Elvin to
add it to your response protocol in case the network team needs to check if
power or WiFi is functioning off hours.
2. I will coordinate internally to ensure security team is briefed. (@Erika
Ellis - can you connect with Julia
directly on #1 above, and to tell her how Security should alert Omega if
they notice the WiFi is down off hours)
3. Assess the communication breakdown that occurred and propose fix.
(Why was it not clear to everyone that we were up and running on our
secondary by Mon evening?) Elvin proposed some ideas about this. Ideally, I
would have liked a call -- at any time 24/7 -- informing me that the
network failed over to secondary, and is working; and Omega is engaged with
Cogent/Verizon and will update.
Let's take a second to acknowledge the network failover worked as designed.
That is excellent.
Thank you

would it be possible to give all PH Admin staff and all fabrication shop

Notes - Technical walk thru of Kode Labs network requirements https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-hRba58k8Bs5JkSSDS1PI1tT9lXh2wXu6sv2j_7o8dY/edit
Upon kick-off of the project:1) Reverse Proxy Agent Installation- Our team will require 1 hour with your IT technician to install the reverse proxy server. This can be accomplished during the meeting. - The server requirements for hosting the reverse proxy agent are listed on the last page of the attached document.- The dependency is that this is hosted on a Windows or Linux server with access to the internet (Ports 443, TCP Port 7844, and UDP Port 7845)2) Aggregation Server (Niagara) Installation- Once the Reverse Proxy Agent is installed, we will need to install Niagara to operate as the aggregation server for the site. - This can be hosted on the same, or different, available server on the network that has a network connection to the reverse proxy agent (from Step 1) and the EnteliWEB server.- Our proposal includes performing the installation of the Aggregation Server and the discovery of all BACnet points on the network. - Server requirements for Niagara can be found here: Niagara Server RequirementsBoth steps are dependent upon having a local server(s) which can host both the Reverse Proxy Agent and the Aggregation Server software.

Subject: 11/29/23:  Monthly Meeting Agenda for Powerhouse

Hi all,
Below is the agenda for tomorrow's meeting. We do have a hard stop at 5 pm tomorrow.
Please let me know if you have any questions, additions and/or concerns. Looking forward to our call.
Warm regards, Erika
Powerhouse Agenda
* S/W, H/W Reporting status
* Brightgauge Ticket and Inventory (Addigy) Reporting
* POM status for Door Aps
* OS Upgrades, specifically Macs in Print Shop that are out of compliance (O/S not upgraded and not getting security updates and low storage space)
* Status of Software updates
* Yarisbeth/HR submissions for builds
* Contacts for TNS
* Support, Account Manager, other
* Building
* Wyze Camera per Mitch request - requires hard wire or AP
* Service Ticket #5226123 - Mitch with Kode Labs
* Security concerns with additions to the network
* Network Questions
* Powerhouse is an unusual office structure with lots of metal and 3-foot-thick concrete walls, so I imagine Wi-Fi performance is different from a typical corporate office. Do you have a sense, or have we ever done a walkaround mapping, of the overall Wi-Fi penetration around the whole building? Pretty strong? Any dead spots?
* I see some spots like at the front door where we've got two AP's right nearby each other. I think that predates your tenure, but do you have any idea if that was done for a particular reason?
* Do we use 2.4 as well as 5 ghz, and can you educate me as to whether that makes any meaningful difference in a space like Powerhouse?
* Are the motion sensors and locks and so on riding WiFi? Could we partition those small-payload long-distance things to 2.4?
* Is Meraki mesh, and can you educate me whether that makes any meaningful difference in a space like Powerhouse?
* Tickets:
* Service Ticket #5232506 - Re: No Wifi at the Gatehouse
* Service Ticket #5201123 - Salesforce Login
* Ticket Process
* Escalation via AM
* Submit tickets prior to Dan going onsite so we can prioritize

Subject: Slack error messages / Jacqueline Veliz

Jacqueline Veliz was issued a computer sometime in the recent past.
She's experiencing a recurring intermittent slack popup. When she enters
her password, it just prompts her again, in a loop. I've run into this
before and think it had to do with permissions on the Slack installation
(?):
[image: image.png]
Please
1/ diagnose and fix Jacqueline's problem.
2/ let me know if Slack is on the standard build image and whether there's
something we should fix on that
Thank you

Subject: zoom phone @ Print Shop (updating #5157642)

Presently, Zoom IVR at 718-522-1400 says "for the Print Shop, press 3."
This appears to ring x402.
Instead, Luther would like:
- IVR to ring x302, which rings two handsets in the shop
- If x302 goes to voicemail, email should go to the print shop group (the
way that x402 does now)
- print shop can give up x402

Subject: PI: For Dan - Finder Setup for New Builds for Powerhouse

Hi CSD,
This is for Dan to complete.
Dan, per our monthly meeting with Powerhouse, Steven wants the Finder setup for all new onboardings
* Need to setup a standard setup:
* TNS to complete Finder setup (Standard Setup) with the following
* Box at the Top, then Shared Resources, and turn on the Show Tab, Status Bar and Hide Path (all three to show, not hide)
* Dan before we build all machines with this process we need to show it to Steven before the next onboard to get his approval and confirm it is exactly how he wants it.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Steven,
All is well and I hope you are all staying warm. Yes, this does apply to Powerhouse.
Per our testing, we do not anticipate any disruption to Powerhouse or any clients during this process. N-central, Omega’s Remote Monitoring Management (RMM) tool will be rolled out in the background. To date, we have not seen any interruptions or concerns in testing environments.
In our doing so, it will allow this tool to sit side by side of TNS’ RMM tool so we can ensure that RMM is working with N-Central prior to TNS removing our RMM tool (ConnectWise Automate).
Please let me know if you have any further questions or want to discuss.

AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE TNS GROUP, AN OMEGA SYSTEMS COMPANY
Steven,
As part of The TNS Group’s continued integration with Omega Systems, we have started the process of mapping out integrations for customer software and toolsets, including the migration of remote monitoring and management (RMM) platforms.
In the coming weeks, Omega will be transitioning TNS customers from Automate to N-Central for RMM services.
During this process, we will be deploying a new agent to your workstations and servers in conjunction with our existing agent to ensure all assets are accounted for during the migration. The existing agent will continue to provide monitoring, patching and remote support until a cutover date for your network is established. As part of the process, our migration team will be auditing your network to ensure all devices have been accounted for and transitioned properly to our new platform.
The N-Central RMM platform has several key features including patching, reporting and automation which will directly benefit you as an Omega customer. If you have access to your current RMM platform (Automate), we will provision access to your new RMM platform (N-Central) following the migration and schedule a personalized training session to share the new features with you.
You will also receive a communication in the near future regarding upcoming patch schedules and an overview of new alerts and reports which will be available to you as part of the N-Central platform.
Please keep an eye out for further communications, including a specific migration/cutover date. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please reach out to your account manager for more information.
Best Regards,
All of us at The TNS Group, an Omega Systems company

Hi David,
I wanted to touch base regarding the shared file for applications/software that you created. Rob has a portion of the documentation available. I wanted to touch base to see if you are still in need of this or do you want to discuss during our monthly meeting or we can take it offline
Let me know what is of importance on your side at this time.
Also, I don't know if I ever gave you my cell phone number for any urgent matters - 203-981-8902.

Hi Erika:
Is Omega keeper of Powerhouse's Techsoup account?
Can you please send Brittni and I the account number (I think it's called that -- but may be "service number" or something) so that I'm able to log in to the Powerhouse account?
Also, can you assist Brittni is the purchase and download she's seeking to make?

Hi Erika:
Is Omega keeper of Powerhouse's Techsoup account?
Can you please send Brittni and I the account number (I think it's called that -- but may be "service number" or something) so that I'm able to log in to the Powerhouse account?
Also, can you assist Brittni is the purchase and download she's seeking to make?

Dan should maintain his regular Wednesday schedule.
Rob should come onsite for the generator test.
Thank you for checking to clarify.
Hi David,
I wanted to touch base and reconfirm the onsite 11/21 for the outage. Thank you for the approval on the billable component so we can schedule the resources. Per a recent email, you had asked if Dan can go onsite on that Tuesday 11/21 and stay late for the outage. He can do that and work with Rob remotely on any issues. Or do you want Dan to maintain his Wednesday onsite and have Rob onsite on 11/21?
On our side, either way will work for any testing/other.
Please confirm – I just want to make sure we are on the same page. Thank you, Erika

like Powerhouse has a MBP 14 in inventory and some MB Air 13"s. Do they want to replace it with one out of inventory, quote a new one or have the user get one on their own?"

If you prefer to use the customized form we can do so as well. Most clients have been going toward the generic and putting all details in Notes – we can handle as you see fit.
IMPORTANT: When you submit the form, please alert me immediately. With all of the changes with the migration I want to proactively make sure that forms are received by support until things settle.
Other option: Complete the form, save as a PDF and send to me.

Hi Michala,
Thank you very much. All received and confirmed that we will proceed with
the Professional plan. I'll separately and shortly route the invoice and
vendor forms to our finance team and you, with Jessica in copy. Going
forward (no need for adjustment on these materials) do you mind setting me
up to be the main contact for the account (email and phone number in my
signature)?
I will expedite the payment process (likely via ACH); will the subscription
and full account access begin only once the payment clears? We'll wait and
allow David to weigh in on the best timing for him to start a separate
trial to explore API options using the sandbox account.
Thank you,

The questions Megan mentioned are these: Re What online integrations are possible in zkipster? can you clarify: the Enterprise plan provides access to an "open API" and the Professional plan supports a "zkipster Custom API." Are there technical differences or cost differences (apart from the plan cost)? Re Salesforce pre-built integration, can you provide a document of what data is captured in zkipster and what data is included in the Salesforce integration. What's the total loaded cost, including any Salesforce connector costs? API Documentation requires a zkipster account. Can you provide either the document or a login invitation? What are the most common ways that customers integrate ticket sales with zkipster?

Hi Megan,
Thanks for your call yesterday to confirm the details and next steps. As
discussed, please find a quote for the Professional level plan for
$3,771.45. You'll see I've applied our 15% non-profit discount to this
quote as well. For efficiency, I've also included an invoice for this plan.
Let me know if you have any questions or need adjustments made on either.
Attached please also find the complete vendor form and our W8BENE (we
provide this in place of the W9, as we are a Swiss-based company).
Just confirming here in writing that when you are ready, you can begin a
separate trial and testing period of the API using a zkipster sandbox
account. This will allow you to continue using zkipster for events in your
main account, without an impact from test API calls. If/when you are ready
to move forward with using the API to automate workflows, we will prorate
the upgrade costs according to the days remaining on your existing
subscription.
Let me know if there is anything else you need at the moment.
All the best,
Michala

The questions Megan mentioned are these: Re What online integrations are possible in zkipster? can you clarify: the Enterprise plan provides access to an "open API" and the Professional plan supports a "zkipster Custom API." Are there technical differences or cost differences (apart from the plan cost)? Re Salesforce pre-built integration, can you provide a document of what data is captured in zkipster and what data is included in the Salesforce integration. What's the total loaded cost, including any Salesforce connector costs? API Documentation requires a zkipster account. Can you provide either the document or a login invitation? What are the most common ways that customers integrate ticket sales with zkipster?

One this call it would be helpful to understand how you currently organize your data and what event information is relevant to send to and from zkipster. A few key questions to discuss together would be: - What contact data (specific custom fields or objects) do you hope to capture both in zkipster and your CRM Name, Email, Event Gift Level (Ticket (type), Table, etc), Gift Amount, date received, Event level status (paid, pledged, pending), Guest names - What is the current data journey (including ticketing data and guest data) and how will that data get into zkipster? Ideal: Save the Date & Invite go out through zkipster to full prospect/invite list; Allow capture of inquiries through save date, and Registration through Invite email to our Event page (PHA website - processed by GiveLively), where they purchase Ticket or submit pledge form for Tables - What is your team structure in terms of owning steps in the process of cultivating event data Our core team will be small: me - main PHA user, PR lead, Production lead, David- Tech lead, + 5 users on event day - How quickly would you like the zkipster integration to be up and running? ASAP following successful trial run and exploration :) We've scheduled 30 minutes for this call, so we can certainly see how far we get in the discussion and answer any other initial questions you have and schedule a follow up call next week, if needed.

Hi Michala,
I didn't realize the additional API Access would be so significant. I'd
like to connect with Steve, David (if possible) and Dan before we sign on
to assess needs there. It's been tough to understand what we need with
David out. Let's keep the call on Monday (thanks, Amy for sending the

The questions Megan mentioned are these: Re What online integrations are possible in zkipster? can you clarify: the Enterprise plan provides access to an "open API" and the Professional plan supports a "zkipster Custom API." Are there technical differences or cost differences (apart from the plan cost)? Re Salesforce pre-built integration, can you provide a document of what data is captured in zkipster and what data is included in the Salesforce integration. What's the total loaded cost, including any Salesforce connector costs? API Documentation requires a zkipster account. Can you provide either the document or a login invitation? What are the most common ways that customers integrate ticket sales with zkipster?

Hi Megan,
Jessica is OOO enjoying some much deserved holidays, but your trial is
ending today so I wanted to check-in with you to see:
- If you have time for a call tomorrow or Friday to share feedback and
discuss next steps
- If there are any questions on the API side of things at this stage? I
know you mentioned David was attending to a personal matter last week but
if there are any questions there, happy to answer them.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
All the best,
Michala

Hi Megan,
Sure, happy to. To change the default 'from' email, you'll just need to
white label your domain. Here is an article on how to configure that.
There
is one preliminary step that David will need to do, but from there you'll
be able to add emails powerhouse.org on your own.
Let me know if you have any other questions.
Best,
Jess

Hi Jessica,
Thank you for checking in. I've started playing around with a trial
campaign and lists, and will be discussing more with members or our event
team today and Monday. David will be offline be present for a personal
matter.
I was curious with respect to his tech assessment of the functions, if you
can help guide me on the default 'from' email, as it currently is default
is setup as noreply@worldsbest.events. Could you help guide me there?

Hi Megan and David,
Looking forward to speaking shortly. One this call it would be helpful to
understand how you currently organize your data and what event information
is relevant to send to and from zkipster. A few key questions to discuss
together would be:
- What contact data (specific custom fields or objects) do you hope to
capture both in zkipster and your CRM
- What is the current data journey (including ticketing data and guest
data) and how will that data get into zkipster?
- What is your team structure in terms of owning steps in the process of
cultivating event data
- How quickly would you like the zkipster integration to be up and running?
We've scheduled 30 minutes for this call, so we can certainly see how far
we get in the discussion and answer any other initial questions you have
and schedule a follow up call next week, if needed. Talk soon!

The questions Megan mentioned are these: Re What online integrations are possible in zkipster? can you clarify: the Enterprise plan provides access to an "open API" and the Professional plan supports a "zkipster Custom API." Are there technical differences or cost differences (apart from the plan cost)? Re Salesforce pre-built integration, can you provide a document of what data is captured in zkipster and what data is included in the Salesforce integration. What's the total loaded cost, including any Salesforce connector costs? API Documentation requires a zkipster account. Can you provide either the document or a login invitation? What are the most common ways that customers integrate ticket sales with zkipster?

Hi Julia,
Good day!
Thank you for your patience. Hope this message finds you well.
After thorough investigation, and ruling out all the limitations in adding the field buttons. It appears that “New Opportunity” action needs to be added to the lighting page highlight panel in order to appear on the opportunity page.
I believe mentioned below workaround will result in achieving the expected results. Please let me if you face any difficulties from your end and let me know your availability for a screen share session on 03/04 or tomorrow, so that we can resolve it at the earliest.
Steps to achieve the workaround:
1. Open any opportunity record
2. Click on the clog Icon → Edit page
3. Select Highlight panel
4.Click on "Upgrade now" under "upgrade to dynamic actions" section on the right side panel.
5.Select Migrate and click on Next
6.Select the respective page layout and select Finish.
7.Click on Add Action and select "New Opportunity" and click Done
8. Now rearrange the order as needed and click on Save

Thank you for the response.
I logged to your organization and tried to find the troubleshoot in resolving this issue.
However, as you don't have enough access to page layouts and lighting app builder edit page it is hindering me from investigating this issue further, could you please help us in granting the login as an admin with your salesforce admin's help.
Steps need to be performed by your admin to provide login access to salesforce support:
a. Click Avatar/Profile | Settings | My Personal Information | Grant Login Access.
b. Set the access expiration date for salesforce.com support (1 week)
c. Click Save

Hi Julia,
Thank you for the response.
I logged to your organization and tried to find the troubleshoot in resolving this issue.
However, as you don't have enough access to page layouts and lighting app builder edit page it is hindering me from investigating this issue further, could you please help us in granting the login as an admin with your salesforce admin's help.
Steps need to be performed by your admin to provide login access to salesforce support:
a. Click Avatar/Profile | Settings | My Personal Information | Grant Login Access.
b. Set the access expiration date for salesforce.com support (1 week)
c. Click Save

Hi Julia,
Good day!
Thank you for your patience. Hope this message finds you well.
After thorough investigation, and ruling out all the limitations in adding the field buttons. It appears that “New Opportunity” action needs to be added to the lighting page highlight panel in order to appear on the opportunity page.
I believe mentioned below workaround will result in achieving the expected results. Please let me if you face any difficulties from your end and let me know your availability for a screen share session on 03/04 or tomorrow, so that we can resolve it at the earliest.
Steps to achieve the workaround:
1. Open any opportunity record
2. Click on the clog Icon → Edit page
3. Select Highlight panel
4.Click on "Upgrade now" under "upgrade to dynamic actions" section on the right side panel.
5.Select Migrate and click on Next
6.Select the respective page layout and select Finish.
7.Click on Add Action and select "New Opportunity" and click Done
8. Now rearrange the order as needed and click on Save

Hi Julia,
Good day!
Thank you for your patience. Hope this message finds you well.
After thorough investigation, and ruling out all the limitations in adding the field buttons. It appears that “New Opportunity” action needs to be added to the lighting page highlight panel in order to appear on the opportunity page.
I believe mentioned below workaround will result in achieving the expected results. Please let me if you face any difficulties from your end and let me know your availability for a screen share session on 03/04 or tomorrow, so that we can resolve it at the earliest.
Steps to achieve the workaround:
1. Open any opportunity record
2. Click on the clog Icon → Edit page
3. Select Highlight panel
4.Click on "Upgrade now" under "upgrade to dynamic actions" section on the right side panel.
5.Select Migrate and click on Next
6.Select the respective page layout and select Finish.
7.Click on Add Action and select "New Opportunity" and click Done
8. Now rearrange the order as needed and click on Save
If you have any questions or wish to share any information, please feel free to approach us via case comments or emails. We are committed to ensuring a prompt and satisfactory resolution for you.

Great, I just tried, looks like I don’t have access to do this. Can we also
upgrade my access in general to whatever the full access is? I’m not able
to do most of what I need to do to update old records and tidy up with my

The security team has a staff list with phone numbers for Powerhouse Arts, Workspace 11, Alpha Workshops, and Manhattan Graphics Center. The gatehouse security guard will call that person to verify if they should be granted access to the Powerhouse Arts building. Please share this protocol with your guests, vendors and for deliveries. Additionally, please provide a backup contact if you potentially might not be available and be mindful that if you do not answer your phone from the security team there could be a delay. If the security team isn't able to connect with the contact person then they will then be required to contact the engineering department so they can then find the contact person. As a reminder, visitors and visiting artists may request parking, but Ceramics members are limited to Forecourt parking only when loading and unloading.

Subject: Re: Vehicle Access at PHA: Visitors, Gatehouse, Parking

David, the context is that the new security measures means the gatehouse
staff have to reach the printshop. I cannot be the sole vibrating pocket on
my cell phone.
Our 4th floor shop phones do not ring simultaneously. They aren’t loud
enough to hear if the equipment is running. If you are at one end of the
shop and hear the phone you have to stop production and run to get the
phone. You may not reach it before it goes to voicemail.
Previously the security measures allowed our guest to enter the building or
forecourt and reach us when we had a delay in production via AEC or the
forecourt security. With this new system they are stuck at the gatehouse
until they can reach us by phone. For guests on foot this means they are
stuck in the rain or snow or sweltering heat. For trucks that means 1st St
is backed up until we can be reached.
Our shop phones aren’t adequate to this task which means we will have to
have a flow chart of personal mobile extensions to fill the gap.

We have a second line that unfortunately has a different extension. Neither
phone is loud enough to hear, at their highest level, when all the
equipment is running. They ring just enough times so that if I can take
off my PPE and sprint the length of the building I might be able to pick up
before it goes to voice mail. The phone on the west/Gowanus side makes a
nice little song that sounds charming but not a true ring like a phone.

Adding some data points:
Jan 9
- 2:24PM Luther reported being unable to get to Box
- 2:35PM Megan reported "the wifi is out"
- 2:39PM Jenn Choi reported problems getting online
In this time frame Steve came to me and reported that he and others in a
meeting in the main conference room lost WiFi.
When I checked, I saw WiFi signal but no internet access, and within a
minute it came back online.
It felt like an ISP outage / power outage on a key device / DNS issue.

Hi David,
Thank you for this email and following up with me.
Since I haven't gotten any emails from BMS@PowerhouseArts.org I believe
there hasn't been a critical alarm generated yet.
Today I will email Rudy and cc you on it to create a critical alarm so we
can test this out. Since I will be out of the office tomorrow and we have
an all day retreat on Wednesday I might not be able to follow up with this

Talk soon,

Subject: sending DMS alerts to facilities team

Hello Mitch!
I know Rudy's OOO for a couple days, and I'll be OOO Monday, so I thought
it may be helpful to summarize where we are with BMS alerts. I'm copying
Dan so he'll know some additional technical details.
Here's the bottom line: BMS critical alerts are now generating emails to
mitch@powerhousearts.org. When you give the word, we can generate emails to
facilitiesengineers@powerhousearts.org. I know the vendor talked about
setting up SMS alerts. If they're not able to deliver on it timely, we can
do it from our side; let me know. As an alternative, we're sending BMS
alerts to a slack channel, #alerts-facilities, which you and your team can
get on now.
Here's some nitty gritty detail:
1. We looked at the BMS system and see that sending alerts is like other
systems we've both used: you need to
1. set up the outgoing email server that the BMS will use to send
email alerts;
2. configure the equipment alarms and put them into groups (like
Critical, Informational);
3. set alerting actions for each groups (like send an email alert for
any Critical alarms).
2. The vendor set up the SMTP (outgoing email) server incorrectly.
Daniel corrected the port number and security protocol setting, and now the
server works. The BMS system has the proper network connections to send
email. The BMS system uses google.smtp.com to send emails FROM the
address bms@powerhousearts.org.
3. As a test we subscribed a new user "status-alerts@powerhousearts.org"
to ALL email alerts, and we subscribed "status-alerts@powerhouserarts.org
and "mitch@powerhousearts.org" to CRITICAL alerts. Alerts are
successfully flowing through. We haven't seen any CRITICAL alerts. That can
be either because there have not been any critical equipment alarms, or
because we have not flagged equipment alarms as CRITICAL, so they don't
fire off an alert.

Here's what's up:

Subject: PH:  - For Response TIMELY on Monitoring for Powerhouse 

Hi CSD,
Below please see the request below in RED from David at Powerhouse. He wants to know if we can generate specific alerts. I spoke to Rob N. who told me to send a ticket so CSD/engineering can research and test this.
This is a VERY TIMELY matter. Please get back to David asap.

As I'm thinking about it, can you please direct whoever can do it to:
- provide authoritative list of cameras including model, ip address, location ID, and whether they require POE
- generate camera outage alerts to status-alerts@powerhousearts.org or provide me access to Genetec so we can set that up
- Erika - as a high priority, can you find out if we can generate alerts on change of poe status on any port, also forwarded to status-alerts@powerhousearts.org. and let's do so.
Thank you
Thank you.
Can you please get an authoritative list of cameras including model, whatever we use for a location ID, and whether they require POE?
Should be able to dump this info from Genetec.
Do all the cams require POE?
Hi TNS Support,
At the present time there are a large number of security cameras out in the building, please see the previous email. I reached out to my security vendor and they suggested I contact IT support to checkout the POE switches. How shall we proceed ?
Thanks,

I found a few more while searching the system.
Hi Team,
David and I are scheduled to look at the POE switches prior to the end of this afternoon.
I will follow up with this email shortly.

Hey Mitch,
As we discussed earlier today, I checked the system and gave it a reset but only certain cameras are down on the Exterior, 1st and 2nd floor of the building. I gave Eugene a call to ask and he advised me to have the IT department give it a check. May be related to networking or a possible POE switch malfunction.
We can still review camera footage on the ones still operating and create/access our key card system of Gentec.
Good night, the CCTV is down at this moment. S-95 Guard just messaged me in regards to this.

Hi Mitch,
Thank you & David for meeting with myself & John today. I’d like to recap out visit today in this email so we are all on the same page.
Card issues/not being returned:
There seems to be an issue with cardholders returning their cards at the end of the day so you are looking for a reasonable & cost effective solution for temporary guests. I will go over this with John on what we find and present the ideas to you. More so, I think issuing a temporary mobile credential may be the route to go but we will see. Give us some time to look into this and will provide feedback on this.
Namely/Genetec integration:
I had mentioned that there is a tool internal to Genetec but needs to be properly configured to map the 2 entities to be work properly. Id leave this for Genetec to do through their professional services if we decide to go this route. Reason being is because there is an existing database already In the system and would hate if the integration would overwrite what is already in the system. I’ve attached the document from them on this tool.
Wireless lock issue delay:
We may be looking at a distance issue/building structure for that one door to the left of the lobby. Possible solution/test would be to splice a cable, remove gatway and put it directly next to the door and see if this fixes the issue.
Mitch Punch List items:
Powerhouse to finish before we return
E109 door still being worked on.
124A by metal loading & receiving, still missing electrified lock
Hallway on 1st fl by freight elevator- strike installed, no pathway to it.
Hydro car (X1) camera not working: This was corrected today.
Y2 Passenger elevator camera not working: The 2N converter connections had melted internally from possible spike in current. Today, we had noticed that the previously configured cat6 cable, was putting out POE, again when the prior was setup for ETHERNET only. How did we know that? The 2N converter takes only one source of power, so when it detects 120V & power from the POE switch in the 5th floor, it will stay off. It is a very good possibility that a configuration change was made, and both POE & power from the outlet, simultaneously have been giving this 2N converter power for some time now, which had MELTED the converter. The manufacturer will not cover this under warranty. Please see image below:
[Image]
Since the Y2 elevator is deemed the more important elevator, we took the converter from X1 and put it at Y2 to get it back online. IT, needs to configure the PORT to put out ONLY Ethernet and to make sure it is in the correct vlan. I was with Alex at the 5th fl IDF and labeled the patch cord for Y2. It was designated to be plugged into the bottom most switch. Please have IT, configure a port to be on security VLAN(10.0.9.XXX), and to NOT put out POE for this port. Now it is unplugged from switch & unplugged from Y2 converter.
A new converter will be needed to be installed and installed but, in the meantime, IT can manage to correct this very simply. Once configured, you can plug it into the designated port AND in the Y2 elevator controller to the 2n converter. It will come back online immediately.
Front door LED to stay green:
Could not understand why it doesn’t stay green when unlocked. It goes green when you swipe at the reader but that’s about it.
Typically a card reader used 6 conductors, not 4, to have the green LED function. There was 18/4 ran to all the doors so this is more than likely why it wont response to stay green when on an unlock schedule. It wont affect functionality besides just a LED light. Would need to find additional conductors next to the door to get this function to work properly.
License Plate Reader
They are all functioning besides the “entrance LPR on the gatehouse”. LPRs are not designed to show up on the monitoring for videos, its own separate entity. They are working 24/7 and capturing license plates. I had shown Alex on what needs to be done in order to access the cameras. You simply go onto security desk, hit the “READS”, and run reports for specific LPRs. You can adjust the date & time when looking for specific plates.
Here Is todays reads for example:
One camera IS OUT. Undetermined what it is. The camera was installed over a year ago and anything could be a reason for it to not work. These are way beyond warranty repairs and/or free replacements. Its possible that mother nature could be the fault for the camera being defective but regardless of the reason, the camera is not covered under Genetec warranty anymore. We can provide a proposal to include replacing of this camera, if need be. Otherwise, the remaining of the cameras are ALL working properly.

Hi Eugene:
Copying in Dan, who is our network tech onsite Weekly.
Can you confirm re the 2N converter: does it care if POE is present or not?
I don't know its purpose, but looking at it, and seeing that it's a $300+ item, I would have guessed that it would accept POE or non-POE ethernet, and handle it reasonably.
Also, since all our ethernet is powered by default, it seems likely (Dan may know) that the ethernet going to the burnt converter has always been POE, and the ethernet going to the functioning converter is also POE, which -- if it's true -- would make me think POE is not an issue.
If the converter can handle both POE and non-POE, that would relieve us from the error-prone administrative requirement of ensuring that we keep a port non-powered and keep specific cables in those specific ports.
Thank you for looking into it and educating me.

David, it is a NON POE device.
It will not work with POE. It requires Ethernet only because its power source is from an outlet. So, I’m 100% POe has been flipped back on and will not let the device operate until POE has been turned off.

Hi Eugene:
Copying in Dan, who is our network tech onsite Weekly.
Can you confirm re the 2N converter: does it care if POE is present or not?
I don't know its purpose, but looking at it, and seeing that it's a $300+
item, I would have guessed that it would accept POE or non-POE ethernet,
and handle it reasonably.
Also, since all our ethernet is powered by default, it seems likely (Dan
may know) that the ethernet going to the burnt converter has always been
POE, and the ethernet going to the functioning converter is also POE, which
-- if it's true -- would make me think POE is not an issue.
If the converter can handle both POE and non-POE, that would relieve us
from the error-prone administrative requirement of ensuring that we keep a
port non-powered and keep specific cables in those specific ports.
Thank you for looking into it and educating me.

Eugene:
Thanks very much for this thorough and thoughtful update.
*>> Card issues/not being returned:*
Can you confirm the specs on the readers and tell me, what are the
different kinds of readers present in the building and what channels and
protocols they support?
- Schlage Wireless door locks + Wireless Gateway
Prox card readers and cards = RFID? NFC?
Bluetooth 3.0 (?) to Gateway + Cat 6 from Gateway to panel (?)
Wireless distance spec'd by Schlage? 15' ?
- Schlage Wired readers
- Elevator Card Readers
Mobile sounds great.
*>> Namely/Genetec integration:*Thanks for the doc! I'll take a look.
Totally agree, we would not want to do anything destructive to the database.
At the simplest level, I'm just interested in extracting a current listing
of cards and cardholders on an ongoing basis. Maybe there's
a scheduled reporting option that would suffice.
*>> Wireless lock issue delay:*Seems plausible.
I'm surprised that the print lab is having signal problems; the
gateway-to-lock distance seems pretty short and unobstructed.
Can you check whether we're on the latest firmware?
How many Schlage Gateways are at Powerhouse?
*>> MELTED converter. *Wow! I'll have someone take a look at that.
*>> License Plate Reader*How does Powerhouse know when a piece of equipment
has failed? Do we raise an alert? Is it possible to fork "high priority"
alerts to a monitored email address (status-alerts@powerhousearts.org) so
we have multiple means ensuring that it's caught?

Hi Mitch,
Thank you & David for meeting with myself & John today. I’d like to recap
out visit today in this email so we are all on the same page.
*Card issues/not being returned:*
There seems to be an issue with cardholders returning their cards at the
end of the day so you are looking for a reasonable & cost effective
solution for temporary guests. I will go over this with John on what we
find and present the ideas to you. More so, I think issuing a temporary
mobile credential may be the route to go but we will see. Give us some time
to look into this and will provide feedback on this.
*Namely/Genetec integration:*
I had mentioned that there is a tool internal to Genetec but needs to be
properly configured to map the 2 entities to be work properly. Id leave
this for Genetec to do through their professional services if we decide to
go this route. Reason being is because there is an existing database
already In the system and would hate if the integration would overwrite
what is already in the system. I’ve attached the document from them on this
tool.
*Wireless lock issue delay:*
We may be looking at a distance issue/building structure for that one door
to the left of the lobby. Possible solution/test would be to splice a
cable, remove gatway and put it directly next to the door and see if this
fixes the issue.
*Mitch Punch List items:*
*Powerhouse to finish before we return*
*E109 door still being worked on. *
*124A by metal loading & receiving, still missing electrified lock*
*Hallway on 1st fl by freight elevator- strike installed, no pathway to it.*
*Hydro car (X1) camera not working:* This was corrected today.
*Y2 Passenger elevator camera not working: *The 2N converter connections
had melted internally from possible spike in current. Today, we had noticed
that the previously configured cat6 cable, was putting out POE, again when
the prior was setup for ETHERNET only. How did we know that? The 2N
converter takes only one source of power, so when it detects 120V & power
from the POE switch in the 5th floor, it will stay off. It is a very good
possibility that a configuration change was made, and both POE & power from
the outlet, simultaneously have been giving this 2N converter power for
some time now, which had MELTED the converter. The manufacturer will not
cover this under warranty. Please see image below:
[image: Image]
Since the Y2 elevator is deemed the more important elevator, we took the
converter from X1 and put it at Y2 to get it back online. IT, needs to
configure the PORT to put out ONLY Ethernet and to make sure it is in the
correct vlan. I was with Alex at the 5th fl IDF and labeled the patch cord
for Y2. It was designated to be plugged into the bottom most switch. Please
have IT, configure a port to be on security VLAN(10.0.9.XXX), and to NOT
put out POE for this port. Now it is unplugged from switch & unplugged from
Y2 converter.
A new converter will be needed to be installed and installed but, in the
meantime, IT can manage to correct this very simply. Once configured, you
can plug it into the designated port AND in the Y2 elevator controller to
the 2n converter. It will come back online immediately.
*Front door LED to stay green:*
Could not understand why it doesn’t stay green when unlocked. It goes green
when you swipe at the reader but that’s about it.
Typically a card reader used 6 conductors, not 4, to have the green LED
function. There was 18/4 ran to all the doors so this is more than likely
why it wont response to stay green when on an unlock schedule. It wont
affect functionality besides just a LED light. Would need to find
additional conductors next to the door to get this function to work
properly.
*License Plate Reader*
They are all functioning besides the “entrance LPR on the gatehouse”. LPRs
are not designed to show up on the monitoring for videos, its own separate
entity. They are working 24/7 and capturing license plates. I had shown
Alex on what needs to be done in order to access the cameras. You simply go
onto security desk, hit the “READS”, and run reports for specific LPRs. You
can adjust the date & time when looking for specific plates.
Here Is todays reads for example:
*One camera IS OUT. Undetermined what it is.* The camera was installed over
a year ago and anything could be a reason for it to not work. These are way
beyond warranty repairs and/or free replacements. Its possible that mother
nature could be the fault for the camera being defective but regardless of
the reason, the camera is not covered under Genetec warranty anymore. We
can provide a proposal to include replacing of this camera, if need be.
Otherwise, the remaining of the cameras are ALL working properly.

*1) Reverse Proxy Agent Installation*
- Our team will require 1 hour with your IT technician to install the
reverse proxy server. This can be accomplished during the meeting.
- The server requirements for hosting the reverse proxy agent are listed on
the last page of the attached document.
- The dependency is that this is hosted on a Windows or Linux server with
access to the internet (Ports 443, TCP Port 7844, and UDP Port 7845)
*2) Aggregation Server (Niagara) Installation*
- Once the Reverse Proxy Agent is installed, we will need to install
Niagara to operate as the aggregation server for the site.
- This can be hosted on the same, or different, available server on the
network that has a network connection to the reverse proxy agent (from Step
1) and the EnteliWEB server.
- Our proposal includes performing the installation of the Aggregation
Server and the discovery of all BACnet points on the network.

Our desktop computer we use for 3d modeling and running the potter bot keeps freezing, even when restarting.
We really need it to keep projects on time.
Could we get you in to look at it?
Thanks,
Jeff

Hi David,
Per your email below, we spec’d out 4 MacBook Pros for Powerhouse, as you know. We can give 3 to Ceramics and 1 to the new hire (tech person). Does cover everything, or do we need to order an other MacBook for Ceramics per your email below - you stated, 3-4 computers for ceramics + 1 for incoming hire.
I just want to make sure we don’t come up short. Please advise.

Hi
Can you please initiate an order for 3-4 (?) computers for ceramics + 1 for incoming IT hire (eventually). Dan will know how many and what kind.
Hi All,
We're trying to consolidate our computer usage so that laptops aren't shared with multiple members in our department. There is a laptop here that Jeff told me to reach out to see if we can get it reset; there are currently just a few former employees that have accounts on it that we can't get into. I'd also like to transfer my programs from my current computer if possible and set up an account on the "new" laptop. Is this something we can do today or this week?
Thank you,
Evan

Hi
Can you please initiate an order for 3-4 (?) computers for ceramics + 1 for incoming IT hire (eventually). Dan will know how many and what kind.
Hi All,
We're trying to consolidate our computer usage so that laptops aren't shared with multiple members in our department. There is a laptop here that Jeff told me to reach out to see if we can get it reset; there are currently just a few former employees that have accounts on it that we can't get into. I'd also like to transfer my programs from my current computer if possible and set up an account on the "new" laptop. Is this something we can do today or this week?
Thank you,
Evan

Hello David,
We have several methods of monitoring your ISP and Network equipment.
PRTG is our monitoring software for your ISP.
We have probes that will continuously ping the ISP IP’s. Should an ISP go down, a ticket is automatically generated and handle by our team. These come in as code red and are handled promptly. POC’s are always notified in these scenarios.
As you will see from the Graphs below, there were no packet loss on 1/9 and 1/10, thus no alert was sent to us.
[A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]
[A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]
For the internal network, we also have alerts generated from the Meraki systems should internal wifi or switches go offline.
This also showed to be stable during the outage indicated. Also with your two ISPs you would have failover, should the primary ISP go down the secondary would kick in.
We can try to do some more in depth analysis to try and pinpoint the issues with you devices at the time of the network delay.
Would you be able to provide the mac address or IP of the devices in question. I can try to see which APs those were connected to and see if there were any issues with the APs as well.

Hi David,
Steve and Rob were reviewing this when you sent the ticket in. Rob is going through the ticket/issues so he can provide a detailed response. He will get back to you by the end of the day today (Rob is copied here).
For any network concerns, our support team leads will escalate to engineering so they can review all facets of the situation in further detail. Yes, we have monitoring in place for the network and Internet. This is also on our agenda for next week to explain or monitoring so we can answer any questions.
Thank you, Erika

Thanks for the update, Dan!
I think it's wrong that the outage would be long enough for 3 users to message me, and Steve to walk to my desk, and I wouldn't be able to know or find out anything about it.
Do you have any sort of standard agent you use to ping from an internal computer to the outside world every minute or so, and raise appropriate alerts?

Hello David
After look into this outage it looks like all of devices remained online when the internet for cogent had a blip.
This why there is no alert for an isp link being down, to ensure all is well I reinstalled the PRTG probes that are connected to the switch at power house I will continue to wait to hear back from cogent to see why their internet went down.
Thanks

There was clearly an issue with our ISP yesterday...
[[Screenshot 2024-01-10 1.01.47 PM.png]]
Request:
Put in place an alert or tripwire so that the tech team is able to alert users to outages, rather than the other way around.*
Adding some data points:
Jan 9
- 2:24PM Luther reported being unable to get to Box
- 2:35PM Megan reported "the wifi is out"
- 2:39PM Jenn Choi reported problems getting online
In this time frame Steve came to me and reported that he and others in a meeting in the main conference room lost WiFi.
When I checked, I saw WiFi signal but no internet access, and within a minute it came back online.
It felt like an ISP outage / power outage on a key device / DNS issue.
Hi All:
FYI: it seems as if WiFi on PH Internal went offline for a minute within the past 10 minutes.
Can you take look and let me know if you see anything?

This why there is no alert for an isp link being down, to ensure all is well I reinstalled the PRTG probes that are connected to the switch at power house I will continue to wait to hear back from cogent to see why their internet went down.
Thanks

There was clearly an issue with our ISP yesterday...
[[Screenshot 2024-01-10 1.01.47 PM.png]]
Request:
Put in place an alert or tripwire so that the tech team is able to alert users to outages, rather than the other way around.*
Adding some data points:
Jan 9
- 2:24PM Luther reported being unable to get to Box
- 2:35PM Megan reported "the wifi is out"
- 2:39PM Jenn Choi reported problems getting online
In this time frame Steve came to me and reported that he and others in a meeting in the main conference room lost WiFi.
When I checked, I saw WiFi signal but no internet access, and within a minute it came back online.
It felt like an ISP outage / power outage on a key device / DNS issue.
Hi All:
FYI: it seems as if WiFi on PH Internal went offline for a minute within the past 10 minutes.
Can you take look and let me know if you see anything?

Hi David,
Steve and Rob were reviewing this when you sent the ticket in. Rob is going through the ticket/issues so he can provide a detailed response. He will get back to you by the end of the day today (Rob is copied here).
For any network concerns, our support team leads will escalate to engineering so they can review all facets of the situation in further detail. Yes, we have monitoring in place for the network and Internet. This is also on our agenda
for next week to explain or monitoring so we can answer any questions.
Thank you, Erika

Thanks for the update, Dan!
I think it's wrong that the outage would be long enough for 3 users to message me, and Steve to walk to my desk, and I wouldn't be able to know or find out anything about it.
Do you have any sort of standard agent you use to ping from an internal computer to the outside world every minute or so, and raise appropriate alerts?
